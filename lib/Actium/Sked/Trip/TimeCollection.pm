=head1 NAME

Actium::Sked::Trip::TimeCollection - Class representing collection of
 schedule times

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium:::Sked::Trip::TimeCollection
version 0.014

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is a Moose class, representing the collection of times
associated with a trip of a transit schedule.  It might contain times
for all the stops on a trip, or only those that are published in
schedules ("timepoints"). It is normally held by the Actium::Sked::Trip
objects.

All data is read-only once created.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

The object is constructed by passing a parameter named "times" to the
"new"  constructor.

=head2 B<times>

This must be a reference to an array of Actium::Sked::Trip::Time
objects, each one representing the time the vehicle passes a stop. See
Actium::Sked::Trip::Time and Actium::Time for more details.

There should be one entry for each entry in the schedule (either stops,
if this is a set of times for stops, or places, if this is a set of
times for places). Some trips do not serve all stops, and entries
representing unserved stops or places should have an Actium::Time value
that means "service does not stop here".

=head1 METHODS

=head3 C<times()>

The C<imes> method returns a list of the times.

=head3 C<time( I<index> ) >

The C<time> method returns the time object at the specified index.

=head3 C<slice( I<index>, I<index>, ... ) >

The C<slice> method returns the times at the specified indices.

=head3 C<count()>

The C<count> method returns the count of the times.

=head3 C<equals($other_collection)>

The C<equals> method checks if two time collections are equal: the
current collection and the one passed in the argument. It returns a
boolean value: true if they are equal.
