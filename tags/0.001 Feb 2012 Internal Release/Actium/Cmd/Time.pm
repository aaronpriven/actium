actium time -- convert timenums to timestrings

Usage:

actium time <time>...

Converts times (found on the command line) between a time number 
(an integer: minutes after midnight, or before midnight if negative) 
to a time string (hours:minutes), or vice versa.  Any integers are
treated as time numbers; anything else is treated as a time string.

Because command-line options are preceded by a hyphen, negative numbers
require special treatment. Either precede all times with a double dash ("--"),
which indicates that following command-line arguments will not be processed
as options, or alternatively enter negative numbers with an "n" instead
of a minus sign ("n10" will be treated as -10).
