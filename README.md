What is Actium?
===============

Actium is a project to release publicly some code and data used to
create public information materials for [AC Transit](http://www.actransit.org)
(online timetables, printed schedules at stops) using a series of Perl
programs, Applescript programs, FileMaker databases and 
InDesign documents.

What's here now is (almost entirely) just the Perl programs, which
I am slowly reorganizing and rewriting. It is not ready yet for
anybody else to use, but perhaps those who are interested can at
least see what it looks like.

## Why the name "actium"?

It was chosen because it is a word beginning with "ACT" (for "AC Transit"). 
It is the name of peninsula in Greece; it gave its name to an 
important 
[battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium) that gave rise to
the Roman Empire.
