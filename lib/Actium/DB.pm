head1 NAME

Actium::DB - role for common database behaviors

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in a composing class

 package SomeDB 0.001;
 use Actium('class');
 with 'Actium::DB';

 sub _connect { 
    return DBI->connect('something');
 }

 # using the composed class
 
 use SomeDB;
 my $db = SomeDB->new();
 my @tables = $db->tables;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::DB is a role that covers behaviors common to all databases
using DBI: both SQLite and FileMaker.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

These are methods that must be provided by the consuming class.

=head2 _connect

This method must connect to the database and return a DBI database
handle.

=head2 _fetch_table_names 

This method must query the database and return all the table names.

=head2 _make_table_object

 my $table = $self->_make_table_object($table_name);

This method must return the table object that should be associated with
the specified table name.

=head1 PROVIDED PUBLIC METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES

=head2 dbh

This Moose attribute returns the DBI database handle.

=head2 is_a_table

 say "Is a table" if is_a_table('table_name');

This returns true if the passed parameter is a valid table in the
database.

=head2 table_names

This method returns the names of the tables known to be in the
database.

=head1 PROVIDED SEMI-PRIVATE METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES

These are intended to be used only within consuming classes.

=head2 _add_table

 _add_table (table_name => 'this_table', table => $some_table);

This method adds a table to the database. There are two named
parameters. 'table_name' is required and is the name of the table.
'table' is optional, and is the object representing the table. (If it
is not provided, then if it is requested the method '_make_table_obj'
will be invoked.)

This is intended to be used only by consuming classes, which are
responsible for actually creating the table in their databases using
the appropriate SQL via DBI.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 Can't add $table_name: Table by that name already exists"

An attempt was made to add a table whose name already exists in the
list of tables this database contains.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The Actium system, and L<DBI|DBI>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

None known. Issues are tracked on Github at
L<https://github.com/aaronpriven/actium/issues|https://github.com/aaronpriven/actium/issues>.
