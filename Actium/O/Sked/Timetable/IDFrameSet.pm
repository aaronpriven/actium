head1 NAME

Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrameSet - Object representing a set of 
InDesign timetable frames

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrameSet;
 my $frameset = Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrameSet->new(
     description       => 'Landscape halves',
     compression_level => 0,
     height            => 42,
     frames            => [
         {   widthpair => [ 4, 1 ],
             frame_idx => 0,
         },
         {   widthpair => [ 5, 0 ],
             frame_idx => 2,
         },
     ],
 );

 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each page of an Actium timetable document in InDesign consists of a series 
of text frames that are linked to each other, and to the pages before 
and after. 

These frames overlap, and the actual text is placed in an appropriate frame
depending on the specific size of the timetable and what other timetables are
placed with it on the same page.

This object represents a set of frames, and contains the frame objects and
the compression level.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item B<description>

An optional text description of this frame (usually something like 
"Portrait halves" for two frames representing two halves of a portrait page).
At this point it's not used for anything, but it's convenient to have a place
for it in I<new()> calls.

=item B<is_portrait>

True if this frameset represents a portrait page. Defaults to false.

=item B<frames>

Required during construction, it consists of the frames that make up the 
frameset. Frames are described in 
L<Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrame|Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrame>.
In the constructor, it should be passed as an array reference; it will be 
returned as a plain list of objects.

If any of the values passed in the I<frames> entry is an unblessed hash 
reference, Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrameSet will pass it to 
Actium::O::Sked::Timetable::IDFrame->new() and use the result. 
(So, you don't have to explicitly create the IDFrame objects; this module
will do it for you.)

=item B<height>

Requiretd during construction, this is the height 
of these frames in terms of rows in the table. It should be specified
excluding the number of rows used for the header (line name, direction, days,
and timepoint names).

=item B<compression_level>

An integer, it represents the amount of shrinkage this timetable will be 
subjected to. Compression level 0 is full size; compression level 1 is smaller;
compression level 2 is smaller yet; etc.

The idea is that timetables that are small can be printed with bigger type or 
with bigger table cells, while timetables that are large might need to be
shrunk ("compressed") to fit on a page.  The various IDFrame objects are 
designed to allow different sizes to be used in different circumstances.
