<h1 class="title">Bus Stop Naming and Announcing Protocols</h1>
</header>
<p>The naming of stops is a difficult matter. Because stop names are
used in several different contexts (in lists of a bus line’s stops, in
trip plans, in on-board announcements, in service disruption notices,
and more), the names must be presented in different ways. At the same
time, these different presentations must still be recognizable as the
same stop across these contexts.</p>
<p>So, there are two separate but related tasks: <em>choosing the best
name</em> for a stop, and <em>presenting that name</em> in various
circumstances.</p>
<h1 id="principles-of-naming">Principles of naming</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop names used for the public should be names that members of
the public will understand. The primary responsibility in creating them
is to help passengers use the transit system.</p></li>
<li><p>The name of a stop does not have to <em>uniquely</em> identify a
stop. A stop name describes a small group of stops that are close to
each other -- usually within sight – where no single bus trip stops at
more than one of them, and where passengers can use signs to find the
one they need. So, there are typically two stops on either side of a
street intersection, both of which have the same name. In a transit
center, typically all the stops will have the same name, since they are
within sight of each other. A stop name <em>is</em> supposed to uniquely
identify the area where a stop is located.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="stop-name-components">Stop name components</h1>
<p>A stop name should be made from three different components, which,
due to the varying needs of different presentations, should be stored
separately.</p>
<h2 id="on">On</h2>
<p>This is usually the street on which the bus operates. When a stop is
located within a transit center or on the grounds of an institution, the
<strong>on</strong> is usually that name instead: “Eastmont Transit
Center,” “Bay Fair BART,” “California School for the Deaf,” “Juan Crespi
Middle School.”</p>
<h2 id="at">At </h2>
<p>This is usually the cross-street at which the bus stops, but the
concept is a little broader than that. The <strong>at</strong> is what
narrows down the larger group of stops described by the
<strong>on</strong> into the smaller set of stops within sight of each
other. So, for example, there are many stops <strong>on</strong> Main
St., but only one or two <strong>at</strong> 1st Ave.</p>
<p>For some locations, such as transit centers, the name of the location
fully describes the stop location, so no <strong>at</strong> is
necessary.</p>
<p>A street address number is a kind of <strong>at</strong>, but is
presented differently.</p>
<h2 id="additional-text">Additional text</h2>
<p>The additional text is wording used to clarify the location of the
stop for the public.</p>
<p>Three categories of additional text are common:</p>
<p><strong>Critical Landmark.</strong> In some cases, a stop is at a
street intersection, but a nearby landmark is so prominent that it
outweighs that intersection in importance. In these rare cases, the
landmark name should be added to the stop name. These might include
train stations, transit centers, major hospitals, middle and high
schools, or universities. Including landmarks in the names should be the
exception, not the rule. Elementary schools, businesses, local shopping
centers, building names, government buildings with few public services,
places of worship, service organizations, and apartment complexes should
not be included. These critical landmarks should <em>describe the
location</em> of the stop, not merely be close to the stop.</p>
<p><strong>Additional At.</strong> Sometimes, it is best to include the
name of another nearby cross-street in the name, when the actual closest
cross-street is minor and the other nearby cross-street is very
prominent. An example would be where a major arterial road changes into
a minor street at the intersection, or where a small court is closer to
the stop than a major roadway. However, only when the additional street
name far outweighs in importance the primary street name should it be
included.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Text.</strong> Occasionally it is necessary to
distinguish a stop from another stop in another way – one that is not so
close by that it is within sight of the first. The usual example is when
curvy streets intersect twice, and so a clarification such as “north
intersection” or “south intersection” must be added to distinguish the
stops. (For this purpose, “intersection” rather than “junction” is
preferable.)</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a situation where it would be beneficial
to use more than one piece of additional text. If this odd situation
should in fact occur, the separate pieces should be stored separated by
semicolons (“Short St.; North Berkeley BART”).</p>
<h1 id="choosing-a-stop-name">Choosing a stop name</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The two most important factors when choosing a name for a stop
are <em>permanence</em> and <em>prominence</em>. Stop names should not
need to be changed often, nor should they refer to things that are not
obvious to a potential passenger. However, sometimes these factors are
in conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>The paths people take as they travel – streets, trails and
pathways – are the primary way people navigate, and therefore their
names are the best way of indicating stops. They also have names that
rarely change, and streets are almost always prominently signed. Thus,
most bus stops should be named for the street on which they travel and
the closest cross-street. Even if a stop is a few hundred feet from the
nearest intersection, as long as it is the closest stop to that
intersection, the cross-street is usually the best name.</p></li>
<li><p>Street suffixes (“Avenue,” “Street,” “Boulevard,” etc.) should
always be included in some presentations (such as written stop lists).
In others, where brevity is crucial, it may be reasonable to omit the
most common ones. However, suffixes are often important to disambiguate
similarly named streets, and any removals must be carefully chosen to
make sure that no ambiguities result. It is preferable to include them
all, rather than to drop them by default and only put back ones that
have been recognized as resolving ambiguities.</p></li>
<li><p>Only where there is no cross-street, or for some other reason
using it is not desirable, then local landmarks should be considered for
the “at” component of the stop name. In these rare cases where there is
no cross-street, nearby landmarks of lesser importance can be considered
for the name, even when those landmarks aren’t as important as the
“Critical Landmarks” referred to above. For example, one would never
need to add an ordinary business name to a name with a good cross-street
(never “<del>Broadway at 14th St. (Walgreens)</del>”), but for a stop
mid-block, the nearby business may be the best name available (“81st
Ave. at U-Haul”).</p></li>
<li><p>Parks, government buildings or facilities, and to a lesser extent
hospitals, schools, and private institutions such as places of worship
and service organizations are long-lasting and prominent, so these can
be good names. Note that the name of the institution itself is
sufficient – it is better to use “Fire Department” instead of “<del>Fire
Department driveway</del>,” “Main Library” instead of “<del>Main Library
entrance</del>.”</p></li>
<li><p>Compared to these kinds of landmarks, businesses move more often
and have names that change more often. Using names of businesses, even
prominent ones like Walmart or Target, should be avoided if other
alternatives are available. The names of business parks, shopping
centers, or apartment complexes, although often not as prominent as
business names, are typically longer-lasting, and should be used
instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Address numbers are not as meaningful as other ways of naming
stops, and should be used only as a last resort. People don’t typically
navigate by address numbers until they are very close to their final
destination.</p></li>
<li><p>Transit agencies, where they do not own the facility being named,
honor the names used by those who do. Cities and (in unincorporated
areas) counties own the streets and parks and decide on their names;
train stations are named by those who own and operate them; other
institutions also decide on their own names. We might justifiably
disagree with the name “Warm Springs/South Fremont BART” for several
reasons, but it is not our place to say.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stop-name-style">Stop name style</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop names should be in English, but when appropriate, any
Unicode character should be eligible for inclusion in a stop
name.</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of directional prefixes (“West Grand,” “East 14th
St.”) varies locally. In some cities they distinguish completely
different streets and must be included. In others, they merely
distinguish address numbers from each other, and can be omitted. This
varies by city and even by location within a city, so omissions should
be chosen carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>If a cross-street changes names near the stop (e.g., one side of
Broadway is Pleasant Valley Ave., the other side is 51st St.), the
cross-street name used should be the one on the side of the street where
the bus travels. (The cross-street on the other side may be added as
additional text.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Opposite” should not be used in stop names.</p></li>
<li><p>Address numbers, where absolutely necessary, should be taken from
the side of the street the bus is traveling, unless there is no
development on that side of the street. When address numbers are used,
they should always be numbers on signage visible to pedestrians near the
stop. (It should be noted that the presence of midblock stops that can
only be described by address numbers is often a sign that the stops are
closer together than the stop spacing standards specify. The best way to
deal with a hard-to-describe stop within 600 feet of the stops on either
side of it may be to discontinue its use.)</p></li>
<li><p>Where appropriate, freeways shall be given with just their
highway designation. AP Style uses “U.S. 101,” “I-580,” and for state
highways, “Highway 24.”</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The word “station” shall not be used in BART stations, Amtrak
stations, etc. The name of the service is sufficient: “Bay Fair BART,”
“Fremont Amtrak and ACE,” “Hillsdale Caltrain.”</p></li>
<li><p>Generic terms (“walkway,” “railroad crossing” should be avoided
where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use “Uptown Transit Center” as the <strong>on</strong>
for all the stops there. Names with “Jr.” or a similar suffix will be
spelled without commas: “Martin Luther King Jr. Way”.</p></li>
<li><p>“Lakeshore Avenue” and &quot;Walavista Avenue&quot; in Oakland will be
spelled without an internal space (not “Lake Shore”). &quot;Red Line Avenue&quot;
in Alameda will use an internal space.</p></li>
<li><p>If transit agencies share a physical stop location, it is
preferred that the stop name be the same in the stop inventories of all
agencies sharing that stop. This helps with regional information
dissemination.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-revenue or non-public stops should not be made
public.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-clarifying-information">Further clarifying
information</h2>
<p>Since several stops can have the same name, it is frequently
necessary to use other information in distinguishing the stops. None of
these should be part of the name, but some should often be presented
along with the name.</p>
<p><strong>Corner.</strong> Stops on street corners can be described as
being on the “northwest corner,” “southwest corner,” and so forth, of
the intersection.</p>
<p><strong>Cardinal direction.</strong> Buses serving a stop are going
north, south, east, or west (or some intermediate direction like
northeast).</p>
<p><strong>City.</strong> An exception to the rule that stops with the
same name should be within sight of each other is when stops in
different cities are at intersections with identically named streets or
institutions (e.g., Bret Harte Middle School). In circumstances where
ambiguity is possible, the city should be presented along with the stop
name.</p>
<p><strong>Site (near side / far side).</strong> Although useful inside
the transit agency, this information is jargon and should never be used
for the public. Its main use in public information is that if corner and
site are both provided, the cardinal direction can be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Bay number.</strong> This distinguishes stops within transit
centers. Unless the transit center is very big and stops are very far
away, for the public it is usually better to not use bay numbers, and
instead rely on the lines that serve the stop to distinguish one stop
from another. Note that an important exception is the Salesforce Transit
Center, which is indeed very big and the stops are not all within sight
of each other, even on the same level.</p>
<p><strong>Stop Code.</strong> A public identifying number for the stop
within the transit system. (This field is named for the GTFS term “stop
code,” which is different than an internal-to-agencies-only “stop
ID”).</p>
<p><strong>Clarification.</strong> Occasionally some additional comment
is helpful to distinguish a stop from nearby stops or make it easier to
find, e.g., “on traffic island” or “underneath overpass.” These should
not be part of the stop name, but might be presented in some
circumstances, e.g., a trip plan. These are usually not necessary,
however, since for the transit agency, the geolocation should be
sufficient to find the stop.</p>
<h1 id="presentation">Presentation</h1>
<p>Each of these components should be stored as separate database fields
and made available to data consumers for reassembly in the way that is
best for each application. This could be done by adding fields to the
GTFS stops.txt file, or by making the names available separately.
However, since most data applications will not be customized to use this
detail, it is still important to provide good defaults for these
applications.</p>
<h2 id="general-presentation-principles">General presentation
principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Text should follow conventional rules of English spelling,
grammar, and writing style, including punctuation. Technical limitations
may require in some cases abbreviating information, but this should be a
last resort and should be worked around as much as possible. Rather than
thinking of stop names as <em>data,</em> they should be thought of as
<em>writing,</em> and need to be written properly, just as with any
other passenger communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Names of streets and other components are proper nouns and should
be appropriately capitalized, with the first letters of important words
in capitals. Mixed case is easier to read than all-capitals text. Names
that use irregular capitalizations in ordinary writing (e.g.,
“MacArthur”) should use the same capitalizations in presentations of
stop names. Where generic labels must be used in stop names, they should
be in lower case (“pathway” or “entrance”).</p></li>
<li><p>In writing, numbers shall be given as digits: “1st St.”, “135th
Ave.” Ordinal suffixes (“st”, “nd”, “th”) should not be printed in
superscript.</p></li>
<li><p>In writing, the following abbreviations should be used for street
endings: “Ave.” for Avenue, “Blvd.” for Boulevard, “Cir.” for Circle,
“Ct.” for Court, “Dr.” for Drive, “Pl.” for Place, “St.” for Street, and
“Terr.” for Terrace. Other street names should be spelled out.</p></li>
<li><p>Other abbreviations should be used in specific circumstances:
&quot;Mt.&quot; for &quot;Mount&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Mt. Eden&quot; or other similar place
names, and &quot;Jr.&quot; when used as part of someone&#39;s name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gtfs-stop_name-and-stop_desc">GTFS: stop_name and stop_desc</h2>
<p>GTFS provides two fields designed to provide human-readable stop
information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Required]The <strong>stop_name</strong> field contains the name of a
stop, station, or station entrance. Please use a name that people will
understand in the local and tourist vernacular.</p>
<p>[Optional] The <strong>stop_desc</strong> field contains a
description of a stop. Please provide useful, quality information. Do
not simply duplicate the name of the stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Components should be assembled to form these two fields. The
stop_name should be assembled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;On&gt; at &lt;At&gt; (&lt;Additional Text&gt;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except that a stop with a street address number should be assembled
this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;Street Address Number&gt; &lt;On&gt; (&lt;Additional
Text&gt;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stop_desc should be assembled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;Corner&gt; corner, going &lt;cardinal direction&gt;. Bay &lt;Bay
number&gt;. &lt;Clarification&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No stops should have all these fields present, and the spaces or
punctuation around fields that aren’t actually present should be
omitted. Directions should be spelled out as words (“northeast,”
“south”) and not abbreviated.</p>
<p>The following abbreviations should be used: “Ave.” for Avenue,
“Blvd.” for Boulevard, “Cir.” for Circle, “Ct.” for Court, “Dr.” for
Drive, “Pl.” for Place, “St.” for Street, and “Terr.” for Terrace.</p>
<h2 id="hastus-name">Hastus name</h2>
<p>The Hastus stop name should match the GTFS stop_name, except:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Due to the limited number of characters in the Hastus stop name,
the colon should continue to be used to separate the On and At
components.</p></li>
<li><p>When field length or character set limitations in Hastus prevent
the correct stop name from being used, a close approximation should be
created and used instead.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audible-on-board-announcements">Audible on-board
announcements</h2>
<p>Some announcements on board buses are required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act, but announcements are helpful for all passengers and
the ADA requirements should be viewed as a minimum, not a maximum.
Announcing every stop is helpful for all passengers. At the same time,
too much noise on board buses gives an unpleasant riding experience.
Thus, announcements should not have any information beyond that needed
to identify the stop. Every additional piece of information, added in an
attempt to be helpful, adds to the cacophony on board an inherently
noisy vehicle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The announcement system does not need to announce the first stop
on a line, unless passengers are expected to ride through the layover,
as on loops.</p></li>
<li><p>The announcement system should not announce stops that should not
be used for alighting (such as stops heading toward San Francisco on
Transbay lines that do not accept local passengers).</p></li>
<li><p>If the name of a stop is an address, it should be read as one:
“500 International Blvd.”, not “International Blvd. at 500” or the
like.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, for the second and subsequent stops, it should
announce the <strong>on</strong> only if it changes from the previous
location (even if that location was the first stop and not announced).
If the street changes, it should first announce the <strong>on</strong>
followed by the word “at.”</p></li>
<li><p>For all stops that are announced, the system should announce the
<strong>at</strong>, and where present, the <strong>additional
text</strong>. Street suffixes should be announced wherever possible,
and any words that are typically abbreviated in print should be read out
in full. Say “Avenue” and not “Ave,” for example.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be “Cal State” and “Cal State East Bay” (not spelled
out C-S-U).</p></li>
<li><p>Freeway numbers should be rarely used, but when used, should be
said as follows: “Interstate Eighty”, “Interstate Two Thirty-Eight”,
“Interstate Five Eighty”, “Interstate Eight Eighty, ” etc. “U.S. One Oh
One.” For California state highways: “Highway Thirteen”, “Highway
Twenty-Four,” “Highway Two Thirty-Seven,” etc. (Highway numbers for
non-freeways should not be used, and street names such as “San Pablo
Ave.” or “Mission Blvd.” used instead.)</p></li>
<li><p>Although the “hundred” in highway numbers should not be
pronounced, it should be pronounced in numbered avenues: “One Hundred
Fourth Avenue.”</p></li>
<li><p>“End of line” should be announced after the stop at the end of
the line, if all passengers are expected to alight.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lists-of-a-bus-lines-stops">Lists of a bus line’s stops</h2>
<p>Each stop in a the list of stops of a bus line should be presented in
the same way as the GTFS stop_name, above. In addition, the stop_code
should be presented alongside the name, and the city should also be
listed, either along with each name or as a subheading. So either:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oakland</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Way at 61st St. (55127)</p>
<p>Berkeley</p>
<p>Adeline St. at Alcatraz Ave. (52252)<br />
Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Prince St. (Ashby BART) (52177)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Way at 61st St., Oakland (55127)<br />
Adeline St. at Alcatraz Ave., Berkeley (52252)<br />
Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Prince St. (Ashby BART), Berkeley
(52177)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the presentation, the stop code could also be separated
from the name in a separate column, or using other punctuation than
parentheses.</p>
<h2 id="sign-location">Sign location</h2>
<p>New schedule signs or flags have locations printed on them, partially
for customer use, but mainly to make it possible for the maintenance
crew to install them. Because of this, they should include the site
information not usually included in public information. The general
pattern is “&lt;On&gt; at &lt;At&gt; (&lt;Additional Text&gt;),
&lt;City&gt;, &lt;Site&gt;, &lt;Cardinal Direction&gt;. (Stop
&lt;stop_code&gt;)”</p>
<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fremont Blvd. at Thornton Ave., Fremont, near side, going east. (Stop
52523)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="written-materials">Written materials</h2>
<p>Textual descriptions of stops should generally include the
<strong>on, at,</strong> and <strong>additional text.</strong> However,
these require presentation flexibility. Sometimes, it will be best to
combine multiple stops on the same street into a single description
(“Stops on Broadway at 38th St., 40th St. and 42nd St.”). Since text
descriptions are usually ephemeral, it can be better to use the name of
local businesses as the most prominent landmark (“Broadway at 14th St.,
in front of Walgreens”) rather than the cardinal direction or other ways
of clarifying where the stop is. In any event, clarity and
comprehensibility must be our aim: our deep and singular aim.</p>
