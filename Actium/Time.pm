sub HELP {

actium time -- convert timenums to timestrings

Usage:

actium time <time>...

Converts times (found on the command line) between a time number 
(an integer: minutes after midnight, or before midnight if negative) 
to a time string (hours:minutes), or vice versa.  Any integers are
treated as time numbers; anything else is treated as a time string.

Because command-line options are preceded by a hyphen, negative numbers
require special treatment. Either precede all times with a double dash ("--"),
which indicates that following command-line arguments will not be processed
as options, or alternatively enter negative numbers with an "n" instead
of a minus sign ("n10" will be treated as -10).

=head1 NAME

Actium::Time - Routines to format times in the Actium system

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium::Time version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::Time qw(timenum timestr timestr_sub);
 @times = '1:15a' , '0545p' , '13.15';
 @timenums = timenum(@times);
 # @timenums = 75, 1065, 795
 @timenums = sort { $a <=> $b} @timenums; # 75, 795, 1065
 
 @timestrs = timestr($_);
 # @timestrs = '1:15a' , '1:15p' , '5:45p';

 $timesub = timestr_sub {HOURS => 24, LEADINGZERO => 1 , SEPARATOR => '.' };
 $timestr = $timesub->(75); # '01.15'
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::Time contains routines to format times for transit schedules.
It takes times formatted in a number of different ways and converts them
to a number of minutes after midnight (or, if negative, before midnight).

The routines allow times in different formats to be normalized and output
in various other formats, as well as allowing sorting of times numerically.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item B<timenum(@times)>

B<timenum()> accepts one or more times in string form and returns
the number of minutes after midnight that the time represents.

The string form can be in one of three basic formats:

=over 

=item 1

<hours><minutes><am/pm>

=item 2

<optional negative sign><hours><minutes>

=item 3

<hours><apostrophe><minutes>

=back

Common separators (colons, periods, spaces, commas) as well as a
final "m" are filtered out before determining which format applies. This makes
it easy to submit "8:35 a.m." if you receive times in that format; it will
be converted to '835a' before processing.

All three formats require a leading zero on the minutes, but not on the hours.

The first format accepts hours from 1 to 12, and minutes from 00 to 59. 

The second format accepts any number of hours. Minutes still must be from 
00 to 59.

The third format accepts hours from 0 to 23. It is treated as though it were 
the time on the day before midnight, so "23'59" is returned as -1 (meaning, one minute before midnight).

For the first format, a final "a" is accepted for a.m. times, and a final "p" 
for p.m. times. Two other final letters are accepted. A final "b" is accepted
for times before midnight, so timenum('1159b') is equal to -1 (again, one minute
before midnight).  

A final "x" is accepted for times after midnight on the following day, so 
timenum('1201x') is equal to 1441 (meaning, 1441 minutes after midnight).

As a special case, if there are no numbers in the string at all, it returns 
undef. This is used for blank columns in schedules.

If called in scalar context, returns only the first value.

=item B<timestr(I<TIMES> , I<NAMED PARAMETERS>)>

B<timestr()> takes one or more time numbers (the number of minutes after midnight) 
and returns a formatted string separating hours and minutes, with an optional
a.m./p.m. marker at the end.

If it receives an undefined value instead of a time number, it returns the empty string.

This routine can be called in a multiplicity of ways. I<TIMES> can be specified either
as a flat list of time numbers (meaning, numbers and/or undefined values), or as a 
(single) reference to a flat list of time numbers.  

(Alternatively, times can be specified as the named argument TIME.)

I<NAMED PARAMETERS> can be specified either as a (single) hash reference or as 
a flattened list.

Basically, this means the following all mean the same thing:

 timestr (15, undef, 60, HOURS => 12 , XB => 1);
 timestr ([15, undef, 60], HOURS => 12, XB => 1);
 timestr (15, undef, 60, {HOURS => 12, XB => 1);
 timestr ([15, undef, 60], {HOURS => 12, XB => 1} );
 timestr ( TIME => [15, undef, 60] , HOURS => 12, XB => 1 );
 timestr ( { TIME => [15, undef, 60] , HOURS => 12, XB => 1 } );
 
(Actium::Time is politically liberal and believes strongly in acceptance.)
 
The named parameters are as follows:

=over

=item TIME

The time number, the number of minutes after midnight. (If negative, the 
number of minutes before midnight.)  Alternatively, an undefined value, in
which case timestr returns the empty string.

=item HOURS

The format: either a 12-hour format (with a.m./p.m. markers) or a 24-hour
format (without those markers). Valid values are '12' and '24'. The default
is '12'.

Times more than twelve hours before midnight, or after 36 hours after midnight,
will give an error if an attempt is made to present them in a 12-hour format.

=item APMARKERS

This is a reference to a list of markers for AM/PM status. If the 'XB' parameter
is false, can have either two or four entries, the latter two of which are 
ignored; if XB is true, must have four entries.

 MARKER  USED FOR                  DEFAULT
 0       a.m. times                'a'
 1       p.m. times                'p'
 2       times after midnight      'x'
         the following day
 3       times before midnight     'b'

Useful markers might be [' a.m.' , ' p.m.'] or [qw(A P X B)] .

An error will be generated if this parameter is present and the HOURS 
parameter is '24'.

=item XB

If true, will return times before midnight with marker #3 (default: 'b')
and times after midnight on the following day with marker #2 (default: 'x').
Otherwise, will use markers #0 ('p') and #1 ('a') respectively.  This defaults
to false.

An error will be generated if this parameter is present and the HOURS 
parameter is '24'.

=item LEADINGZERO

If true, the hours will be given with at least two digits: '01:15' instead of
'1:15'. The default is false.

=item SEPARATOR

This is a string that separates the hours from minutes. The default is 
a colon: '1:15a'. Supply the empty string for no separator: '115a'.

=back

If called in scalar context, returns a string of all the time strings joined 
together by tab characters. This is probably not what you want.

=item B<timestr_sub()>

This is designed to make it easier to supply a long list of parameters only once,
saving typing. It accepts all the same named parameters as B<timestr()>,
except TIME, and returns a reference to an anonymous subroutine that allows easy
access to that particular format. The anonymous subroutine accepts one argument,
which becomes the TIME parameter given above.

For example:

 $timesub = timestr_sub {HOURS => 24, LEADINGZERO => 1 , SEPARATOR => '.' };
 $timestr = $timesub->(75); # '01.15' - parameters are preserved
 
Since what happens when you call timestr is that it uses timestr_sub to generate
a subroutine and then promptly throws it away, it is strongly recommended that timestr_sub
be used in your program rather than timestr if the routine is used more than once with 
the same parameters.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Invalid time [$origtime]

An invalid time string, not matching the formats Actium::Time knows about, 
was supplied to B<timenum()>

=item Cannot specify XB for 24 hour string

=item Cannot specify AM/PM markers for 24 hour string

A request was made to use a 24-hour format, and a parameter that doesn't
apply to the 24-hour format was included.

=item Improper number of AM/PM markers

A number of AM/PM markers was given that was other than exactly four 
(or two, if the XB parameter is false).

=item Time out of range

A time number was given for a 12-hour format that was more than 12 hours before,
or 36 hours after, midnight.
