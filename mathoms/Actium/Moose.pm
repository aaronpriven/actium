=head1 NAME

Actium::Moose - Actium customizations for Moose classes

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.013

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use <name>;
 # do something with <name>
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

A full description of the module and its features.

=head1 SUBROUTINES or METHODS (pick one)

=over

=item B<subroutine()>

Description of subroutine.

=item B<< immut() >>

A function that makes a Moose class immutable. It is recommended that
Moose classes be made immutable once they are defined because because 
they are much faster that way. Normally one does this by putting

 __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable

at the end of the class. This function allows replacement of that
unwieldy  code with something that's easier to type.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
