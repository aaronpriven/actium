=head1 NAME

Actium::Types - Moose types for the Actium system

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium::Types version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in a Moose class
 package MyClass;
 use Moose;
 use Actium::Types qw(Schedule_Day);
 
 has 'days' =>
    is => 'rw' ,
    isa => Schedule_Day ,
 );
 # now the days attribute of MyClass is constrained to be a 
 # Schedule_Day value
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a library of types for use with Moose. See L<MooseX::Types> and
L<Moose::Manual::Types>.

=head1 TYPES

=over

=item B<Schedule_Day>

An enumeration of @Actium::Constants::SCHEDULE_DAYS. See L<Actium::Constants>.

=item B<DayCode>

This string represents scheduled days in a newer way, based on the way Hastus
stores them: 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday ... 7 = Sunday, and H = holidays.
They must be in order (e.g., "76" is invalid).

=item B<SchoolDayCode>

A character representing whether the scheduled days run during school days
("D"), school holidays ("H"), or both ("B").

=item B<Str4> and B<Str8>

A string of exactly four characters or eight characters. These are used in 
specifying timepoint abbreviations.

=item B<TimeNum>

A time number, suitable for use by L<Actium::Time>. The number of minutes after
midnight (or before, if negative), or undef.
Coerces strings into TimeNums using Actium::Time::timenum().

=item B<ArrayRefOrTimeNum>

A "union type" -- either an array reference, or a TimeNum.

=item B<ArrayRefOfTimeNums>

An array reference, which must refer to an array consisting solely of TimeNums.
