=head1 NAME

Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops - subsequent stops of a trip in a
stop schedule

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops;
 my $ensuingstops = 
    Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops->new(qw/55555 51038 52382/);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A stop schedule represents a transit schedule at a particular stop. But
one doesn't just want to show the time -- it's also desirable to show
the destination and other information about where that bus is going.
Hence, it's important to store information about the subsequent stops
on the trip. This object stores those subsequent stops. Note that order
is significant here.

Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops caches its objects, so that
passing the same stops will result in another reference to the same
object. This is useful for determining equality of the two sets of
ensuing stops.

 my $ensuingstops1 = 
    Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops->new(qw/55555 51038 52382/);
 my $ensuingstops2 = 
    Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops->new(qw/55555 51038 52382/);
 say "Yes" if $ensuingstops1 == $ensuingstops2;
 # Output: Yes

=head1 CLASS METHOD

=head2 Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops->new(@stopids)

The C<new> method takes a list of stop IDs, determines whether an
object with those stops already exists, and if it does, returns it. If
it doesn't, it creates a new one.

=head1 OBJECT METHOD

=head2 $ensuingstops->stopids

The C<stopids> method returns the list of stop IDs.

=head2 $ensuingstops->is_final_stop

The C<is_final_stop> method indicates that the stop is the final one
(in other words, that there are no stop IDs in the ensuingstops).

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS
