Customized information on flags
-------------------------------

It's actually a bit misleading to say that information is "customized"
for each stop. Actually, what happens is that a computer program
(actium.pl flagspecs) identifies what information is relevant for
each line at each stop.

The program determines, for each stop, what the destination should
be and which connection or other icons should be shown, and then
establishes a code for that combination of destination and icons.

That code is the line number followed by a hyphen and then a lowercase
letter (or letters, but there aren't any lines with 27 combinations
yet). So, the third combination for line 72 will be “72-c”.  Of
course many stops have the same combinations.

A separate process creates artwork (in InDesign) for each of those
combinations. The result is a series of art files, which can be
used to create decals or which can be placed in an InDesign file
to create full flags. (Generally, the term "decals" is used even
when the line information is printed directly on the flag.) In
practice, there are two sets of decal artwork: a "bleed" version
that is used for printing decals, and a non-bleed version used for
placement in InDesign.

Although it's easy enough to create a single flag in InDesign and
have that printed, or send a single decal to be printed by the print
shop, there are some helpful tools that are designed to make this
process easier.

Printing custom decals
----------------------

Custom decals are sent to the print shop for printing. Some tools
have been created to make it easier to count the number of decals
to print, to prepare the print orders, and to prepare labels for
envelopes

### decalcount

This tool is used to help count the number of decals to be printed.
It takes an Excel file that is a list of stops, and creates a new
Excel file that counts the decals to be printed.

The first task is to create the Excel file that is the list of
stops. The first column should contain stop IDs.

The second column should contain a list of lines (separated by
spaces). Only these lines will be included in the decal count. If
this list is blank, then all lines at that stop will be included.
It frequently happens that a flag has all the correct customized
decals except for one or two lines. The second column makes it easy
to make sure that only some of the decals for that stop are printed.

Other columns to the right are ignored by decalcount, but the idea
was that the third column would contain stop descriptions and the
fourth column would contain special instructions to the pole crew
about this stop. (See "decallabels" below.)

|       | A      | B     | C           | D            |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **1** | StopID | Lines | Description | Instructions |
| **2** | 50243  |       | West Midway Ave. at Orion St., Alameda, near side, going north | Replace 31-a "To Alameda Point" with 31-c "To Lexington Street, Alameda Point" |
| **3** | 50244  | 215   | Paseo Padre Pkwy. at Mission View Dr., Fremont, far side, going east | & Make sure 212 is whited out |
| **4** | 50663  |       | Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Virginia St., Berkeley, far side, going north | P |
| **5** | 50773  |       | Castro Valley Blvd. at Santa Maria Ave., Castro Valley, near side, going west |   |

Note that all the lines will be given for all the stops, except
that only Line 215 will be printed for stop 50244.

This Excel file needs to be saved where it can be seen by the Rex
server, such as on Bireme. To run the program, issue the command:

    actium.pl decalcount mydecals/workbook.xlsx

Of course, enter the name of the spreadsheet file you saved in place
of "mydecals/workbook" above.

Once you do that, a new spreadsheet will be created, in the same
folder and with the same name, with "-counted" added to the end
(so, in this case, it would be "workbook-counted.xlsx" in the
"mydecals" folder).

This will result in a new workbook, with two sheets: "Count" and "Stops."

#### Count sheet

Here is a sample "Count" sheet (the data shown here implies more
stops were listed than given above):

|     | A     | B     | C     | D      |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 1   | Decal | Print | Stops | Adjust |
| 2   | 25-p  | 36    | 17    | 0      |
| 3   | 31-a  | 3     | 1     | 0      |
| 4   | 32-e  | 9     | 4     | 0      |
| 5   | 215-c | 5     | 2     | 0      |
|     |       | 53    |       |        |

For each decal, it provides a calculation of how many decals to
print, based on the number of stops and the "adjust" number (which
is added to the calculation, or if it is negative, subtracted). The
last item in the column is the sum of the number of decals to print.

(The calculation is simply that it doubles the number of stops
[since decals have to be printed twice for each stop, once on the
front and once on the back], adds ten percent for spoilage, and
rounds up. So if there's one stop, it will always be three decals;
four stops, always nine decals; and so forth.  Finally, it adds the
value in the "Adjust" column.)

The formula on the Count sheet is "live", so that if you alter the
number of stops, or the "adjust" number, it will also alter the
number of decals to print. This is so that you can make manual
overrides.  Perhaps a stop needs to be added at the last minute.

The "adjust" column is for other manual overrides. For example, one
frequent occurrence is that we have a number of decals on hand that
do not need to be reprinted. To print ten fewer decals, enter "-10"
into the adjust column for the appropriate decal.

Normally, I send the first two columns with the print shop order.
The calculation is in the second column specifically to make this
process easier than if it were the last column.

#### Stops sheet

The Stops worksheet is just for checking that it did what you think
it should have done. It will have the stop IDs and the decals that
go with them:

|     | A       | B             | C           |
| --- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Stop ID | Decals to use | All decals  |
| 2   | 50243   | 31-a          | 31-a        |
| 3   | 50244   | 215-c         | 215-c 239-a |
| 4   | 50663   | 25-p          | 25-p        |
| 5   | 50773   | 32-e          | 32-e        |

Note that 52044 only has 215-c listed "to use", because line 215
was specified for stop 50244 in the first spreadsheet.

### zipdecals

The zipdecals tool is used to package up the appropriate decal
artwork.  It is relatively simple. Issue the command:

    actium.pl zipdecals mydecals/workbook-counted.xlsx

It will create a new ZIP archive of all the decals listed in the
first sheet of the specified workbook. It will save it to a file
in the same folder as the worksheet, with a name that's the same
as the worksheet (except that it will remove "-counted" and put the
proper extension on). In this case, that would be "workbook.zip" .

### decallabels

The decallabels tool is used in the process of making labels which
can be attached to envelopes, suitable for the pole crew's use. It
creates a spreadsheet of label texts, which is designed to be copied
and placed into a Word document that has labels.

The labels that are created contain the stop ID, an abbreviated
stop description, and a set of instructions to the pole crew. What
the instructions say depends on the input file.

#### Input file

The decallabels program reads the same file that was used in decalcount.

    | A      | B     | C   | D   
--- | ------ | ----- | --- | ---
1   | StopID | Lines | Description | Instructions
2   | 50243  |       | West Midway Ave. at Orion St., Alameda, near side, going north | Replace 31-a "To Alameda Point" with 31-c "To Lexington Street, Alameda Point"
3   | 50244  | 215   | Paseo Padre Pkwy. at Mission View Dr., Fremont, far side, going east | & Make sure 212 is whited out
4   | 50663  |       | Martin Luther King Jr. Way at Virginia St., Berkeley, far side, going north | P
5   | 50773  |       | Castro Valley Blvd. at Santa Maria Ave., Castro Valley, near side, going west |

The decallabels program uses the same first two columns as decalcount:
The first column should contain stop IDs, and the second should
contain a list of lines (separated by spaces), where only these
lines will have decals created for them. If this list is blank,
then all lines at that stop will be included.

The third column is intended to contain a stop description (although
the label program doesn't use this). The fourth column contains
special instructions to the pole crew.

#### Instructions

The last part of the label contains special instructions to the
pole crew. What, specifically, they contain depends on the contents
of the fourth column.

- If the fourth column is blank, the instructions will say "Replace
generic decals with \<list of decals\>", that is to say, it includes
the list of decals for this stop. If "Lines" is not blank, then it
adds "Leave other decals." Note that this list will not include
decals that are generic, which are used for 600-series lines.

- If the last column begins with an ampersand ("&"), it will contain
the same text as above, but any remaining instructions will be added
to the end.

- If the last column is just the letter "P", it just says "Place
decals \<list of decals\> on the flag." This list will include all
decals, including generic 600-series decals.

- If the last column is just the letter "N", it says 
"Get a new or re-usable flag from storage. Place \<list of decals\> on 
the flag. Place the stop ID on the flag and install it." 
This list will include all decals, including generic 600-series decals.

- If the last column has anything else, that text is used for the instructions.

#### Output file

The output file is an Excel spreadsheet with three columns. The
first one and third one contain the labels; the second one is empty.
(Actually it has a blank space in each cell.) This is because when
Word creates a label template of the type we normally use, it creates
a table with three cells, where the middle cell is just there to
create space between columns.

To use it, first open Excel, and copy the first three cells in each
row. Note how many rows you're copying.

Then open Word, and select "Labels" in the "Tools" menu. It will
give a dialog box asking about details of the label. Pick a type
of label such as 5161 (4" by 1") or 5162 (4" by 1.33"). (There
should be two columns of labels with an empty column in the middle.)

Do not type anything into the box where the label content is located,
but select "Full page of the same label" and click "OK."

It will create a single page of labels. If there were more rows in
the Excel spreadsheet than are displayed on this page, create more
rows by selecting "Insert → Rows Below" from the Table menu. (It
is useful to type Command-Y to repeat this if necessary.) Keep
inserting rows until there are as many rows in the label sheet as
there were in the Excel document.

Then, and this is tricky, _by dragging from the top left cell,
select all the cells in the table._ Word is very persnickety about
the way it allows you to copy and paste, so (for example) selecting
the whole table by clicking on the little box at the upper left
will not work: Word will resize the table cells, which will screw
up the label placement.

Then select Paste, and the cells will be pasted into the document.
Note that if you select too many rows when you paste, the top rows
will be repeated again at the bottom, filling out the empty cells.

You can then print the labels (select "Paper Feed: All Pages from
Bypass Tray" from the "Paper Feed" section of the print dialog box
to print out labels on the Toshiba copy machine by inserting them,
face-down, in the bypass tray.)

Tools for custom flags
----------------------

### prepareflags

The prepareflags tool is used to create a list of which flags should
be printed and what decals should be present.

There two ways to tell the program what flags to print: using the
FileMaker database or using a separate list of stops in a file.

#### Specifying flags from a file

To use a list of stops in a file, create the file. It can be either
a plain text file (with a file name ending in `.tsv`, `.tab`, or
`.txt`), or an Excel `.xlsx` file.  The program will use anything
in the first column that could be a stop ID as one, and ignore
everything else.  (For plain text files, columns need to be separated
by tabs. A plain text file with just Stop ID numbers should still
work.)

#### Specifying flags from the database

The other way to specify what files are to be printed is to use
data in the FileMaker database. In the database, there is a checkbox
"Print next run." It is located under the Flag tab, in the "Stops
Neue" layout.

The "Print next run" checkbox needs to be checked for those stops,
and only those stops, that are to be printed. This box is located
on the "Flag" tab of the Stops Neue layout.

##### Zeroing out the current stops

First, to make sure that no boxes are still checked from the last
time flags were printed, go into Find mode, click the "print next
run" box, and then perform the find by pressing the return key.
This will display all the records where the box is checked. Turn
them all off by clicking the box (so it is not checked) and then
select "Replace field contents" from the Records menu. This will
open up a little dialog box. Make sure “Replace with: ' ' ” (the
empty string) is selected, and select "Replace." This will turn off
all the pre-existing checkboxes.

Then, find the stops for the flags you want to print, and click the
boxes for those flags.

#### Selecting the flag type

One reason to use the database to specify stops is that each flag
must have a flag type selected in the database, or it won't be
created. The flag type corresponds to the particular art template
that will be used.

The flag type consists of a number, which represents the number of
bus lines that can fit on the front of the flag (the number of
boxes), followed by a letter suffix that indicates a variant on the
usual flag. Current flag types are:

* 3, 4, 6, 8, 10: Typical flags, 19.5" wide by various heights depending on the number of decals. Almost all new flags printed should be one of these sizes.
* 5, 9: Flags that are very similar to the typical flags, but which are at odd heights. I created these to use up old metal that were cut to these sizes, but once that old metal is used up these heights should probably no longer be used.
* 2R, 4R, 6R,10R: These are regular flags, but with the 10.5 inch "Rapid" banner at the top. They should be used where the 1R or 72R are present.
* 2N, 3N, 4N, 5N, 6N: These are narrow flags, of old sizes created in order to re-use old metal (from 1990s-style flags). These should not be used except where old metal exists.
* 2D: This is the Dumbarton Express branded flag, to be used where Dumbarton Express branding is required.
* 7W, 8W: These flags are extra wide flags, used where space on a pole is very limited (due to sharing a pole with other signs) and we can't use a typical size flag. This should only be used where absolutely necessary. (I believe at this writing there are exactly three in use.) The flags are the same size, but 8W reduces the size of the logo, phone number, and so on in order to fit one more bus line.
* 13W, 15W: These are extra wide flags used where there are more than ten bus lines at a single stop.

#### Running prepareflags

Issue the command (replacing "z00" with the current signup, of course):

    actium.pl prepareflags  -signup z00 /path/to/your_list_of_stops.txt

Of course, don't include the list of stops if you're using the checkboxes in
the file.

If you did specify a list of stops, the file
"your_list_of_stops-assignments.txt" will be created in the folder
where your list of stops was found. Otherwise, it will create the
file flag\_assignments.txt in the signup folder. The flag assignments
file is a plain text file that can be edited if desired.

### makeflags\_new.app

This is the Applescript program that creates the flag artwork.

Find the program (on Bireme in Actium/Applications). Double-click
it to open it. It will open up a dialog box that allows you to
choose a file. Choose the flag assignments file created from
`actium.pl prepareflags`. InDesign will do a lot of work in the
background creating the flags. It will write new InDesign files in
Bireme/Actium/flagart/generated. The InDesign files have the same
name as the original flag file (the size), with a date added to the
name.

When makeflags\_new is done, it will put up a dialog box that says
"Finished making flags."

Once the program is complete, you can look at the InDesign files
it created. It's always good to check them for any obvious errors.
Also, it is important to make sure that if trim lines or other
features are requested by the AC Transit Print Shop or another sign
manufacturer, that layers representing these are turned on.

### Save InDesign As EPS ask.app

This is the new program that saves the individual flags as EPS
files. There are two ways to run it. If you double-click on it, it
will save all the pages of the InDesign file you are currently
editing as EPS files. Or, you can drag one or more InDesign files
to the icon in the Finder, and it will do them all.

It will first ask you whether you want to leave any bleed around
the edges (enter "0", since flag artwork has bleed built into it
already). Then it will ask if you want to convert the text to
outlines (which our print shop will request). It will then save a
PDF of each of the InDesign files and then use Illustrator to save
each of those PDF files as EPS files. It will save them in the
folder "PRINT" in the same folder where the InDesign file was
located.

Those EPS files can then be zipped and sent to the print shop.
