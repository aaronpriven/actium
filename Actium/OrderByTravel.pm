=head1 NAME

orderbytravel - produce ordered list of stops by travel along bus routes

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.001

=head1 USAGE

From a shell:

 actium.pl orderbytravel /Some/Directory/Inputfile.txt

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item I<file>

The user must give the full pathname to an input file. The input file
is treated as tab-delimited text, with the first field being the stop ID.

If the first field of a line is 'PhoneID', 'StopID', or 'stop_id_1', 
the line is skipped (since it probably contains column names).

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

This program specifies no options itself, but several modules this subprogram 
uses specify options. See:

=over

=item L<OPTIONS in Actium::Signup|Actium::Signup/OPTIONS>

=item L<OPTIONS in Actium::Sorting|Actium::Sorting/OPTIONS>

=item L<OPTIONS in Actium::Term|Actium::Term/OPTIONS>

=back

A complete list of options can be found by running 
"actium.pl help orderbytravel"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this program is to produce lists of stops ordered by travel 
route. This makes it easier for a maintenance
worker or surveyor to travel down a bus route and visit all the stops,
but without duplicates.

The user specifies an input file which contains stops. The program compares
this to the 'line.storable' file, which contains a list of bus lines and
directions and which stops, in order, are used by those lines.

The result is a list of routings, with the affected stops, with all duplicates
removed. It is designed so that the longest lists possible are given.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item No input file given

No file specification was given on the command line.

=item Can't open file $inputfilespec: $OS_ERROR

An error was found trying to open the file given on the command line.
The file may not have been found, or there may be some other error.

=item Can't open line.storable file: $OS_ERROR

An error was found trying to read the file line.storable. It may not be 
present in the appropriate place (the "slists" folder under the specified 
signup) or there may be some other error.
