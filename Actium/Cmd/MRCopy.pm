=head1 NAME

Actium::Cmd::MRCopy - Copy latest map files from the map repository

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium::Cmd::MRCopy version 0.001

=head1 USAGE

From a shell:

 actium.pl mr_copy <options>
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Actium::Cmd::MRCopy module provides a command-line interface to the 
B<copylatest> routine of Actium::MapRepository. It expects to be run by
actium.pl. See the documentation to actium.pl for more information on the START
and HELP methods.

mr_copy goes through the map repository and copies the very latest 
active map of each line and type to a separate folder. 

Detailed documentation on the maps repository and how to use mr_copy 
can be found in the separate documents, "The Actium Maps Repository: 
Quick Start Guide" and "The Actium Maps Repository: Extended Usage 
and Technical Detail." 

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

The mr_copy program has several options that can be used on the command line. These should be placed after mr_import:

 actium.pl mr_copy -no-web
 
 actium.pl mr_copy -repository /Users/me/MyRepository
 
 actium.pl mr_copy -help
 
However, in practice only a few of them are actually useful.

=over

=item -activemapfile

This allows the user to use a different file than active_maps.txt
as the list of active maps. The file must, however, still be located
in the repository folder.

=item -fullfolder

This allows you to change where copies with the full names are made. The default is "_fullnames" in the repository. Use "-fullfolder" to specify another location on the file system:

 actium.pl mr_copy -fullfolder 
    /Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/CurrentLineMaps
    
"fullfolder" can be abbreviated "ff".

=item -fullnames

This option will copy the files into the "_fullnames" folder (or
whatever the  fullfolder option specifies). This is on by default.
To suppress copying of full names files, use "-no-fullnames" on the
command line.

=item -linesfolder

This allows you to change where copies with just the line names are
made. The default is "_linesnames" in the repository. Use "-linesfolder"
to specify another location on the file system:

 actium.pl mr_copy -linesfolder 
    /Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/LineMapsNoDates
    
"linesfolder" can be abbreviated "lf".

=item -fullnames

This option will copy the files into the "_linesnames" folder (or
whatever the  linesfolder option specifies). This is on by default.
To suppress copying of lines names files, use "-no-linesnames" on
the command line.

=item -repository

The repository is currently located at "/Volume/Bireme/Maps/Repository". To use another repository, specify its full path here. 

=item -web

This option will copy the files into the "_web" folder (or whatever the -webfolder option specifies), and create the JPEG files. This is on by default. To suppress copying and rasterization of web files, use "-no-web" on the command line. 

Rasterization takes the longest time so I suspect "-no-web" is the most likely option to be used.

=item -webfolder

This allows you to change where web files made. The default is "_web" in the repository. Use "-webfolder" to specify another location on the file system:

 actium.pl mr_copy -webfolder 
    /Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/MapsForWeb
    
=item -quiet, -verbose, and -progress

These three options tell the program how much detail to display on screen. 

"-quiet" eliminates all display except text that describes why the program quit unexpectedly. 

"-verbose" displays on the screen a message indicating the names of each map copied or rasterized.

"-progress" produces a running indication of which lines' maps are being 
processed, when " verbose" is not in effect. This is on by default; use "-no-progress" to turn it off.
