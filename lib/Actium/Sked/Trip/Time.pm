=head1 NAME

Actium::Sked::Trip::Time - Times associated with schedules

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium:Sked::Trip::Time;
 my $time = Actium::Sked::Trip::Time->from_str('21:30');
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::Sked::Trip::Time is an object representing a time in a 
schedule. Most of the work is done by
L<Actium::Time|Actium::Time>, q.v. , and all methods supported by
Actium::Time are supported by this module. There are only a small
number of additional methods, which allow the replacement of a time in a
schedule by an interpolated version.

=head1 METHODS 

=head2 was_interpolated

This method returns a boolean value: true if a time has been
interpolated here, false if it has not. This indicates that the time
I<was> interpolated -- to check if a time still needs to be
interpolated, use the method C<is_awaiting_interpolation> (documented in
Actium::Time).

=head2 set_interpolated_str, set_interpolated_num

These methods set the value of this time to a new value. The C<set_interpolated_str>
method expects a string (which is sent to by Actium::Time->from_str), and the
C<set_interpolated_num> method expects a number (sent to
Actium::Time->from_num). They also mark this time as having been
interpolated (which can be queried by C<was_interpolated>).

=head2 from_str, from_num, from_excel

These are the same as their counterparts in Actium::Time, except that
they return an Actium::Sked::Trip::Time object instead of an
Actium::Time object.
