=head1 NAME

Actium::O::Crier - Terminal notification with indentation, status, and closure

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.009

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::O::Crier;

 my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();

 my $task_cry = $crier->cry("Main Task");
 ...
 my $subtask_cry = $crier->cry("First Subtask");
 ...
 $subtask_cry->done;
 ...
 my $another_subtask_cry = $crier->cry("Second Subtask");
 ...
 $another_subtask_cry->done;
 ...
 $task_cry->done;

This results in this output to STDOUT:

 Main task...
     First Subtask..............................................[DONE]
     Second Subtask.............................................[DONE]
 Main task......................................................[DONE]

There are procedural shortcuts for output to a default destination:

 use Actium::O::Crier(cry);

 my $task_cry = cry("Main Task");
 ...
 my $subtask_cry = cry("First Subtask");
 ...
 $subtask_cry->done;
 ...
 my $another_subtask_cry = cry("Second Subtask");
 ...
 $another_subtask_cry->done;
 ...
 $task_cry->done;

This produces the same output as before.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::O::Crier is used to to output balanced and nested messages
with a completion status.  These messages indent easily within each other,
are easily parsed, may be bulleted, can be filtered,
and even can show status in color.

For example, you write code like this:

    use Actium::O::Crier;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new()
    my $cry = $crier->cry("Performing the task");
    first_subtask($crier);
    second_subtask($crier);
    $cry->done;

It begins by outputting:

    Performing the task...

Then it does the first subtask and the second subtask. When these are complete,
it adds the rest of the line: a bunch of dots and the [DONE].

    Performing the task......................................... [DONE]

Your subroutines first_subtask() and second_subtasks() may also
issue a cry about
what they're doing, and indicate success or failure or whatever, so you
can get nice output like this:

    Performing the task...
      Performing a subtask ..................................... [WARN]
      A second subtask...
        Second subtask, phase one............................... [OK]
        Second subtask, phase two............................... [ERROR]
      Wrapup of second subtask.................................. [OK]
    Performing the task......................................... [DONE]

A series of examples will make Actium::O::Crier easier to understand.

=head2 Basics

Here is a basic example of usage:

    use Actium::O::Crier;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
    my $cry = $crier->cry("Performing a task");
    sleep 1; # simulate task performance
    $cry->done;

First this outputs:

    Performing a task...

Then after the task process is complete, the line is
continued so it looks like this:

    Performing a task........................................... [DONE]

Actium::O::Crier works by creating two sets of objects.
The I<crier> represents
the destination of the cries, such as the terminal, or an output file.
The I<cry> object represents a single cry, such as a cry about
one particular task or subtask.  Methods on these objects are used to issue
cries and complete them.

The crier object is created by the C<new> class method of C<Actium::O::Crier>.
The cry object is created by the C<cry> object method of the crier object.

=head2 Exported subroutines: shortcut to a default output destination

Since most output from Actium::O::Crier is to a single default
output destination for that process (typically STDERR), some
procedural shortcuts exist to make it easier to send cries to a
default output.

To use the shortcuts, specify them in the import list in the 
C<use Actium::O::Crier> call.
C<< "use Actium::O::Crier ( qw(cry))" >>
will install a sub called C<cry> in your package that will call
the C<cry> method on the default crier object.
Therefore,

 use Actium::O::Crier ( qw(cry) );
 my $cry = cry ("Doing a task");

works basically the same as

 use Actium::O::Crier;
 my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
 my $cry = $crier->cry ("Doing a task");

except that in the former case, the crier object is stored in
the Actium::O::Crier class and will be reused by other calls to
C<cry>, from this module or any other.
This avoids the need to pass the crier object as an
argument to routines in other modules.

See L</Subroutines> below.

=head2 Completion upon destruction

In the above example, we end with a C<done> call to indicate that
the thing we told about (I<Performing a task>) is now done.
But we don't need to do the C<done>.  It will be called automatically
for us when the cry object (in this example, held in the variable
C<$cry>) is destroyed, such as when the variable goes out of scope
(for this example: when the program ends).
So the code example could be just this:

    use Actium::O::Crier;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
    my $cry = $crier->cry("Performing a task");
    sleep 1; # simulate task performance

and we'd get the same results (assuming the program ends there).

Completion upon destruction is useful especially in circumstances where the
program exits less than cleanly, but also simply when it is convenient to avoid
additional method calls at the end of a function.

=head2 Completion Severity

There's many ways a task can complete.  It can be simply DONE, or it can
complete with an ERROR, or it can be OK, etc.  These completion codes are
called the I<severity code>s.  C<Actium::O::Crier> defines many different
severity codes.

Severity codes also have an associated numerical value.
This value is called the I<severity number>.
It's useful for comparing severities to each other or filtering out
severities you don't want to be bothered with.

Here are the severity codes and their severity numbers.
Those on the same line are considered equal in severity:

    EMERG => 15,
    HAVOC => 14,
    ALERT => 13,
    DARN  => 12,
    CRIT  => 11, FAIL => 11, FATAL => 11,
    ARGH  => 10,
    ERROR => 9, ERR => 9,
    OOPS  => 8,
    WARN  => 7,
    NOTE  => 6,
    INFO  => 5, OK => 5,
    DEBUG => 4,
    NOTRY => 3,
    UNK   => 2,
    YES   => 1, PASS  => 1,
    NO    => 0,

You may make up your own severities if what you want is not listed.
Please keep the length to 5 characters or less, otherwise the text may wrap.
Any severity not listed is given the value 1.

To complete with a different severity, call C<done> with the
severity code like this:

    $crier->done("WARN");

C<done> and its equivalents return with the severity number from the above
table, otherwise it returns 1, unless there's an error in which case it
returns false.

As a convienence, it's easier to use methods that incorporate the 
severity level, such as C<d_ok> or C<d_fail>. See 
L<Convenience methods for "done"|#Convenience methods for "done"> below for 
a complete list.

We'll change our simple example to give a FATAL completion:

    use Actium::O::Crier;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
    my $cry = $crier->cry("Performing a task");
    sleep 1; # simulate task performance
    $cry->d_fatal;

Here's how it looks:

    Performing a task........................................... [FATAL]

=head3 Severity Colors

One feature of C<Actium::O::Crier> is that you can enable colorization of the
severity codes.  That means that the severity code inside the square brackets
is output in color, so it's easy to see.
The module Term::ANSIColor is used to do the colorization.

Here's the colors:

        EMERG    bold blink bright white on red
        PANIC    bold blink bright white on red
        HAVOC    bold blink black on bright yellow

To use colors on all cries, pass 'colorize => 1' as an option
to the C<new> method call:

    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({colorize => 1});

Or, invoke the use_color method on the crier, once it's created:

    $crier->use_color;

Cries also accept the colorize argument or the use_color method,
so that individual cries can be colorized or not.

Run sample003.pl, included with this module, to see how the colors look on
your terminal.

=head2 Nested Messages

Nested cries will automatically indent with each other.
You do this:

    use Actium::O::Crier;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
    my $aaa = $crier->cry("Aaa")
    my $bbb = $crier->cry("Bbb")
    my $ccc = $crier->cry("Ccc")

and you'll get output like this:

    Aaa...
      Bbb...
        Ccc.......................... [DONE]
      Bbb............................ [DONE]
    Aaa.............................. [DONE]

Notice how "Bbb" is indented within the "Aaa" item, and that "Ccc" is
within the "Bbb" item.  Note too how the Bbb and Aaa items were repeated
because their initial lines were interrupted by more-inner tasks.

You can control the indentation with the I<step> attribute,
and you may turn off or alter the repeated text (Bbb and Aaa) as you wish.

=head3 Filtering-out Deeper Levels (Verbosity)

Often a script will have a verbosity option (-v usually), that allows
a user to control how much output to see.  Actium::O::Crier handles this
with the I<maxdepth> attribute and C<set_maxdepth> method.

Suppose your script has the verbose option in $opts{verbose}, where 0 means
no output, 1 means some output, 2 means more output, etc.  In your script,
do this:

    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new(maxdepth => $opts[verbose});

or this:

    $crier->set_maxdepth ($opts{verbose});

Then output will be filtered from nothing to full-on based on
the verbosity setting.

=head3 ...But Show Severe Messages

If you're using maxdepth to filter messages, sometimes you still want
to see a message regardless of the depth
filtering -- for example, a severe error.
To set this, use the override_severity option.  All messages that have
at least that severity value or higher will be shown, regardless of the depth
filtering.  Thus, a better filter would look like:

    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new(
        maxdepth          => $opts[verbose} ,
        override_severity => 7,
      );

See L</Completion Severity> above for the severity numbers.

=head2 Closing with Different Text

Suppose you want the opening and closing messages to be different.
Such as I<"Beginning task"> and I<"Ending task">.

To do this, use the I<closetext> attribute or C<set_closetext> method:

    $cry = $crier->cry(
         "Beginning task" ,
         {closetext => "Ending task"},
      );

Or:

    $cry->set_closetext("Ending task");

Or:

    $cry->done({closetext => "Ending task"});

Now, instead of the start message being repeated at the end, you get
custom end text.

A convienent shorthand notation for I<closetext> is to instead call
C<cry> with a pair of strings as an array reference, like this:

    my $cry=$crier->cry( ["Start text", "End text"] );

Using the array reference notation is easier, and it will override
the closetext option if you use both.  So don't use both.

=head2 Closing with Different Severities (Completion Upon Destruction)

So far our examples have been rather boring.  They're not vey real-world.
In a real script, you'll be doing various steps, checking status as you go,
and bailing out with an error status on each failed check.  It's only when
you get to the bottom of all the steps that you know it's succeeded.
Here's where completion upon destruction becomes more useful:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use warnings;
    use strict;

    use Actium::O::Crier;

    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({default_closestat => "ERROR");
    primary_task();

    sub primary_task {

       $cry_main = $crier->cry( "Primary task");
       return
           if !do_a_subtask();
       return
           if !do_another_subtask();
       $fail_reason = do_major_cleanup();
       return $cry_main->d_warn ({reason => $fail_reason})
            if $fail_reason;
       $cry_main->d_ok;

    }

(Note that "$crier" is set at file scope, which means it is available to
subroutines further in the same file.)

In this example, we set C<default_closestat> to "ERROR".  This means that if any
cry object is destroyed, presumably because the cry variable
went out of scope without doing a C<done> (or its equivalents),
a C<d_error> will automatically be called.

Next we do_a_subtask and do_another_subtask (whatever these are!).
If either fails, we simply return.  Automatically then, the C<d_error>
will be called to close out the context.

In the third step, we do_major_cleanup().  If that fails, we explicitly
close out with a warning (the C<d_warn>), and we pass some reason text.

If we get through all three steps, we close out with an OK.

=head2 Output to Other File Handles

By default, Actium::O::Crier writes its output to STDERR
You can tell it to use another file handle like this:

    open ($fh, '>', 'some_file.txt') or die;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({fh => $fh});

Alternatively, if you pass a scalar reference in the fh attribute,
the output will be appended to the string at the reference:

    my $output = "Cry output:\n";
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({fh => \$output});

If there is only one argument to C<new>, it is taken as the "fh" attribute:

    open ($fh, '>', 'some_file.txt') or die;
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new($fh);
    # same as ->new({ fh => $fh })

The output destination is determined at the creation of the crier object,
and cannot be changed.

=head2 Return Status

Methods that attempt to write to the output (including C<cry> and
C<done> and its equivalents) return
a true value on success and false on failure.  Failure can occur,
for example, when attempting to write to a closed filehandle.

=head2 Message Bullets

You may preceed each message with a bullet.
A bullet is usually a single character
such as a dash or an asterisk, but may be multiple characters.
You probably want to include a space after each bullet, too.

The width used for bullets is the same for all bullets, whatever
is specified. If bullets are shorter than the maximum width,
they are padded out with spaces.

You may have a different bullet for each nesting level.
Levels deeper than the number of defined bullets will use the last bullet.

Bullets can be set by passing an array reference of the bullet strings
as the I<bullets> attribute, or to the C<set_bullets> method, to the crier.

If you want the bullet to be the same for all levels,
just pass the string.  Here's some popular bullet definitions:

    bullets => "* "
    bullets => [" * ", " + ", " - ", "   "]

Also, a bullet can be changed for a particular cry with the
I<bullet> attribute to C<cry> or the C<set_bullet> method
on the cry object.

Here's an example with bullets turned on:

 * Loading system information...
 +   Defined IP interface information......................... [OK]
 +   Running IP interface information......................... [OK]
 +   Web proxy definitions.................................... [OK]
 +   NTP Servers.............................................. [OK]
 +   Timezone settings........................................ [OK]
 +   Internal clock UTC setting............................... [OK]
 +   sshd Revocation settings................................. [OK]
 * Loading system information................................. [OK]
 * Loading current CAS parameters............................. [OK]
 * RDA CAS Setup 8.10-2...
 +   Updating configuration...
 -     System parameter updates............................... [OK]
 -     Updating CAS parameter values...
         Updating default web page index...................... [OK]
 -     Updating CAS parameter values.......................... [OK]
 +   Updating configuration................................... [OK]
 +   Forced stopping web server............................... [OK]
 +   Restarting web server.................................... [OK]
 +   Loading crontab jobs...remcon............................ [OK]
 * RDA CAS Setup 8.10-2....................................... [DONE]

If not all bullets are the same width (according to the Unicode::GCString
module), the bullets will be made the same width by adding spaces to the right.

=head2 Mixing Actium::O::Crier with other output

Internally, Actium::O::Crier keeps track of the output cursor position.
It only
knows about what it has sent to the output destination.
If you mix C<print> or C<say> statements, or other output methods, with your
Actium::O::Crier output, then things
will likely get screwy.  So, you'll need to tell Actium::O::Crier where you've
left the cursor.  Do this by using  C<set_position>:

    $cry = $crier->cry("Doing something");
    print "\nHey, look at me, I'm printed output!\n";
    $cry->set_position(0);  # Tell where we left the cursor
    
(Using C<set_position> will skip the backspacing of the next C<over>.)

=head1 SUBROUTINES, METHODS, ATTRIBUTES REFERENCE

=head2 Subroutines

Three subroutines can be exported from Actium::O::Crier.

These subroutines are exported using C<Sub::Exporter>, so if you prefer a
different name for a subroutine, 
you can specify that using an I<-as> option in a hashref of options after the 
subroutine name.

  use Actium::O::Crier (cry => { -as => 'bellow' } , 
                        default_crier => { -as => 'bellower'} ,
                        cry_text => { -as => {bellow_text} } );

will install the routines using the those names. See L<Sub::Exporter> for more 
detail on I<-as>.

Note that several of these routines are built during the import process,
so cannot be called using a fully-qualified package name. 
Actium::O::Crier::cry("some text") will not do what you want. 
(It will call the method C<cry>, not the subroutine C<cry>.)

=head3 B<default_crier>

Importing B<default_crier> does two things.
First, it creates a C<default_crier> subroutine in your package that returns
the default crier object, allowing it to be accessed directly. This allows most
attributes to be set (although not the filehandle).

 use Actium::O::Crier ( qw(default_crier) );
 $crier = default_crier();
 $crier->set_bullets( ' + ' );
 
If a hashref of options is present after default_crier in the import list,
during the import process, the default crier object will be created with those
options.  
This is the only way to set the filehandle of the default crier object.

Behind the scenes, it is passing these arguments to the
C<< Actium::O::Crier::->new >> class method,
so the import routine accepts all the same options as that
class method.  For example:

 use Actium::O::Crier ( default_crier => { fh => \$myvar , backspace => 0 } );
 
The import routine for C<default_crier> will accept options 
(other than "-as") from only
one caller.  If two callers attempt to set the attributes of the
object via the import routine, an exception will be thrown.

=head3 B<cry>

The C<cry> subroutine will have the default crier object create a new cry.
It accepts all the same arguments as the object method C<< $crier->cry() >>.

=head3 B<cry_text>

The C<cry_text> subroutine will have the most recent cry issue text underneath
it. It works the same as, and accepts all the same arguments as,
the object method C<< $cry->text() >>.

=head2 Class Method

=head3 Actium::O::Crier::->new()

This is the C<new> constructor inherited from Moose by Actium::O::Crier.
It creates a new Crier object: the object associated
with a particular output.

It accepts various attributes as options, which are listed
in L<Attributes|/Attributes> below.
Attributes can be specified
in the arguments to C<new> as a list of keys and values or as
a hash reference.

However, if the first argument is a file handle or reference to a scalar,
that will be taken as the output destination for this crier.

If no arguments are passed, it will use STDERR as the output.

=head2 Crier Object Methods

=head3 $crier->cry()

This creates a new cry. Specifically, it creates a new C<Actium::O::Crier::Cry>
object, and then that object outputs the opening text and the ellipsis:

 my $cry = $crier->cry('Starting a task');

produces the output

 Starting a task...

It accepts various attributes as options, which are listed
in L<Attributes|/Attributes> below.
Attributes
must be provided in hashrefs. If more than one hashref is provided to C<cry>,
then they will all be used as options. If there are conflicts, later items
will take priority over earlier items in the argument list.

Non-reference arguments are taken to be texts, which are concatenated together
(with texts separated by the value of perl's C<$,> variable;
see L<$, in the perlvar man page|perlvar/"$,">) and used as the opening text
of the cry.

If there is only one non-hashref argument, and it is an array reference, then
the first two entries of the array will be used as the opening and closing
text of the cry. In other words,

 $cry = $crier->cry( ['Open text', 'Close text'] );

is the same as

 $cry = $crier->cry(
      { -opentext => 'Open text', -closetext => 'Close text'}
   );

If the open text is not provided using any of these ways, then the
name of the calling subroutine will be used as the opening text.

It is not correct to call C<cry> in void context:

  $crier->cry("Doing something")

Since C<cry> creates a cry object, calling it in void context leaves noplace
to store it. If it is called in void context, the cry will immediately close
with "UNK" severity, and will display 'Cry error (cry object not saved)'.

=head3 $crier->text()

This invokes the C<text> object method on the deepest open cry.
If no cry is open, opens a silent cry.

=head2 Cry Object Methods

=head3 $cry->done()

This closes the cry, either re-outputting the open text
(if it's not on the same line) or outputting the close text,
padding out with the trailer character, and then outputting the severity.

    Closing text.........................................[OK]

It accepts various attributes as options, which are listed
in L<Attributes|/Attributes> below.

Attributes
must be provided in hashrefs. If more than one hashref is provided,
then they will all be used as options. If there are conflicts, later items
will take priority over earlier items in the argument list.

The first non-reference argument is taken to be the closing severity.
If none is provided, it will use the severity that is in the I<closestat>
attribute (whether specified in this call, or earlier as an option in the
constructor or via a method).

One attribute, I<reason>, is only applicable from within a C<done> call
(or its equivalents).

=head3 Convenience methods for "done"

These are called as C<< $cry->d_emerg() >>, C<< $cry->d_ok >>, etc.

For convenience, several methods exist to abbreviate the
C<< $cry->done >> method, for the built-in severities:

 d_emerg  done "EMERG";  syslog: Off the scale!
 d_panic  done "PANIC";  Time to panic
 d_havoc  done "HAVOC";  the dogs of war are let loose
 d_alert  done "ALERT";  syslog: A major subsystem is unusable.
 d_crit   done "CRIT";   syslog: a critical subsystem is not working entirely.
 d_darn   done "DARN";   Darn it, something happened
 d_fail   done "FAIL";   Failure
 d_fatal  done "FATAL";  Fatal error
 d_argh   done "ARGH";   Argh, something I didn't want to happen happened
 d_error  done "ERROR";  syslog 'err': Bugs, bad data, files not found, ...
 d_err    done "ERR";    syslog 'err': Bugs, bad data, files not found, ...
 d_oops   done "OOPS";   Oops, I did it again
 d_warn   done "WARN";   syslog 'warning'
 d_note   done "NOTE";   syslog 'notice'
 d_info   done "INFO";   syslog 'info'
 d_ok     done "OK";     copacetic
 d_debug  done "DEBUG";  syslog: Really boring diagnostic output.
 d_notry  done "NOTRY";  tried
 d_unk    done "UNK";    Unknown
 d_yes    done "YES";    Yes
 d_pass   done "PASS";   Passed a test
 d_no     done "NO";     No

=head3 $cry->d_none()

This is equivalent to C<done>, except that it does NOT output
a wrapup line or a completion severity.  It simply closes out
the current level with no message.

=head3 $cry->prog() and $cry->over()

Outputs a progress indication, such as a percent or M/N or whatever
you devise.  In fact, this simply puts *any* string on the same line
as the original message (for the current level).

Using C<over> will first backspace over a prior progress string
(if any) to clear it, then it will write the progress string.
The prior progress string could have been emitted by C<over> or C<prog>;
it doesn't matter.

The C<prog> method does not backspace, it simply puts the string out there.

If the I<backspace> attribute is false, then C<over> behaves identically to
C<prog>. If the I<shows_progress> attribute is false, does nothing.

For example,

  use Actium::O::Crier('cry');
  my $cry = cry "Performing a task";
  $cry->prog '10%...';
  $cry->prog '20%...';

gives this output:

  Performing a task...10%...20%...

Keep your progress string small!  The string is treated as an indivisible
entity and won't be split.  If the progress string is too big to fit on the
line, a new line will be started with the appropriate indentation.

With creativity, there's lots of progress indicator styles you could
use.  Percents, countdowns, spinners, etc.
Look at sample005.pl included with this package.
Here's some styles to get you thinking:

        Style       Example output
        -----       --------------
        N           3       (overwrites prior number)
        M/N         3/7     (overwrites prior numbers)
        percent     20%     (overwrites prior percent)
        dots        ....    (these just go on and on, one dot for every step)
        tics        .........:.........:...
                            (like dots above but put a colon every tenth)
        countdown   9... 8... 7...
                            (liftoff!)


=head3 C<$cry->text>

This outputs the given text without changing the current level.
Use it to give additional information, such as a blob of description.
Lengthy lines will be wrapped to fit nicely in the given width, using
Unicode definitions of column width (to allow for composed or double-wide
characters).

=head2 Attributes

There are several ways that attributes can be set: as the argument to the
B<new> class method, as methods on the crier object, as arguments to
the B<cry> object method, as methods on the cry object, or
as options to B<done> and its equivalents. Some are acceptable
in all those places!  Rather than list them separately for each type,
all the attributes are listed together here, with
information as to how they can be set and/or used.

=head3 adjust_level

=over

=item I<adjust_level> option to C<cry> or C<text>

=back

Supply an integer value.

This adjusts the indentation level of the message inwards (positive) or
outwards (negative).

This can be applied to a cry, in which case it applies to the cry and
any subsequent messages (C<prog>, C<over>, C<text>) associated with it,
or to just a C<text>, in which case it applies to just that text.

When it is applied to a cry, it affects filtering
via the I<maxdepth> attribute and the bullet character(s) if bullets
are enabled.

=head3 backspace

=over

=item I<backspace> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->backspace() >>

=item set methods: C<< $crier->use_backspace >>> and C<< $crier->no_backspace >>

=back

This attribute determines whether C<< $cry->over >> attempts to send backspace characters
to the terminal or not. Some IDE consoles don't properly deal with backspaces
(I'm looking at you, Eclipse) and so this attribute turns that off.

=head3 bullet

=over

=item I<bullet> option to C<cry>, or C<done> or its equivalents

=item get method: C<< $cry->bullet() >>

=item set method: C<< $cry->set_bullet() >>

=back

Normally, the bullet
for a cry is derived from the I<bullets> attribute of the crier object.
This attribute allows this to be overridden for this particular cry.

The program makes all bullets take up the same width.
When a custom bullet is used, and that bullet is wider than earlier
bullets, the bullet width for the entire crier is made the width
of the widest bullet.

=head3 bullets

=over

=item I<bullets> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->bullets() >>

=item set method: C<< $crier->set_bullets() >>

=back

Enables or disables the use of bullet characters in front of messages.
Set to a reference to n empty array to disable the use of bullets,
which is the default.  Set to a scalar character string to enable
that character(s) as the bullet.  Set to an array reference of
strings to use different characters for each nesting level.  See
L</Message Bullets>.

The program makes all bullets take up the same width.
When bullets are altered, the bullet width is made the width
of the widest bullet ever provided. The bullet width is never reduced.

=head3 closestat

=over

=item I<closestat> option to C<cry>, or C<done> or its equivalents

=item get method: C<< $cry->closestat() >>

=item set method: C<< $cry->set_closestat() >>

=back

Sets the severity code to use when completing a cry.
This is set to the value of the I<default_closestat> option
if not specified in the C<cry> or C<done> call.

See L</"Closing with Different Severities (Completion Upon Destruction)">.

=head3 closetext

=over

=item I<closetext> option to C<cry>, or C<done> or its equivalents

=item get method: C<< $cry->closetext() >>

=item set method: C<< $cry->set_closetext() >>

=back

Supply a string to be used as the closing text that's paired
with this level.  Normally, the same text you use when you
issue a C<cry>
is the text used to close it out.  This option lets you specify
different closing text.  See L</Closing with Different Text>.

=head3 colorize

=over

=item I<colorize> option to C<new>, C<cry>, or C<done> or equivalents

=item get methods: C<colorize> (on either $crier or $cry)

=item set methods: C<use_color> and C<no_color> (on either $crier or $cry)

=back

Set to a true value to render the completion severities in color.
ANSI escape sequences are used for the colors.  The default is
to not use colors.  See L</Severity Colors> above.

Setting the colorize attribute on a cry will affect only that cry.
Setting it in a C<done> call or equivalent, or using a C<use_color>
or C<no_color> on an already opened cry, will affect only the close
of that cry.

Setting the colorize attribute on a crier will affect all
future cries.

=head3 column_width

=over

=item I<column_width> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->column_width() >>

=item set method: C<< $crier->set_column_width() >>

=back

Sets the column width of your output.  C<Actium::O::Crier>> doesn't
try to determine how wide your terminal screen is, so use this
option to indicate the width.  The default is 80.

You may want to use L<Term::Size::Any|Term::Size::Any>
to determine your device's width:

    use Term::Size::Any 'chars';
    my ($cols, $rows) = chars();
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({column_width => $cols});
    ...

One cool trick is to have it set
when the program receives a window change signal:

    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new();
    use Term::Size::Any 'chars';
    local $SIG{WINCH} = \&set_width;
    sub set_width {
       my ($cols, $rows) = chars();
       $crier->set_column_width($cols);
    }

Assuming your system sends the proper signal,
the width of the lines will grow and shrink as the window changes
size.

=head3 default_closestat

=over

=item I<default_closestat> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->default_closestat() >>

=item set method: C<< $crier->set_default_closestat() >>

=back

Sets the severity code to use when completing a cry, if none
is specified in the C<cry> or any C<done> call. Useful when
cries are closed because the object gets destroyed.

=head3 ellipsis

=over

=item I<ellipsis> option to C<new>, C<cry>, or C<done> or equivalents

=item get methods: C<ellipsis> (on either $crier or $cry)

=item set methods: C<set_ellipsis> (on either $crier or $cry)

=back

Sets the string to use for the ellipsis at the end of a message.
The default is "..." (three periods).  Set it to a short string.
This option is often used in combination with I<trailer>.

    Performing a task...
                     ^^^_____ These dots are the ellipsis

Setting the ellipsis attribute on a cry will affect only that cry.
Setting it in a C<done> call or equivalent, or using a C<set_ellipsis>
on an already opened cry, will affect only the close of that cry.

Setting the ellipsis attribute on a crier will affect all
future cries.

=head3 fh

=over

=item I<fh> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->fh() >>

=back

This attribute contains a reference to the file handle to
which output is sent. It cannot be changed once the crier object
is created, so is specified in the argument to C<new>.

=head3 maxdepth

=over

=item I<maxdepth> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->maxdepth() >>

=item set method: C<< $crier->set_maxdepth() >>

=back

Filters messages by setting the maximum depth of messages that will
be output.  (This is how many levels of sub-task, not the severity
level.) Set to undef (the default) to see all messages.  Set to 0
to disable B<all> messages from the crier.  Set to a positive
integer to see only messages at that depth and less.

=head3 muted

=over

=item I<muted> option to C<cry>, or C<done> or equivalents

=item get method: C<< $cry->muted >>

=item set methods: C<< $cry->mute >> and C<< $cry->unmute >>

=back

Set this option to a true value to have the cry close out silently.
This means that the severity code, the trailer (dot dots), and
the possible repeat of the message are turned off.

The return status from the call is will still be the appropriate
value for the severity code.

=head3 opentext

=over

=item I<opentext> option to C<cry>

=back

A string to be used as the opening text, output when the
cry is created.

Normally, this is implicit rather than explicit:

 my $cry = $crier->cry({opentext => 'Doing something'});

is the same as

 my $cry = $crier->cry('Doing something');

See L<< /$crier->cry() >>.

=head3 override_severity

=over

=item I<override_severity> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->override_severity() >>

=item set method: C<< $crier->override_severity() >>

=back

Specifies a severity number that will always be shown, even if
it is so deep that it would otherwise be filtered by the I<maxdepth>
attribute. So, for example, if I<override_severity> is 15, then "EMERG"
and "PANIC" messages will be printed, no matter what depth is used.

If I<override_severity> is negative, I<maxdepth> will always be honored.

See L</...But Show Severe Messages>.

=head3 position

=over

=item get methods: C<position> (on either $crier or $cry)

=item set methods: C<set_position> (on either $crier or $cry)

=back

Used to reset what Actium::O::Crier thinks the cursor position is.
You may have to do this if you mix ordinary print statements
with cries.

Set this to 0 to indicate that the position is at the start of a
new line (as in, just after a C<print "\n"> or C<say>).
See L</Mixing Actium::O::Crier with other output>.

After setting the position, C<over> will not backspace.

=head3 reason

=over

=item I<reason> option to C<done> or equivalents

=back

After the closing, it will output the given reason string on the
following line(s), indented underneath the completed message.  This
is useful to supply additional failure text to explain to a user
why a certain task failed.

This programming metaphor is commonly used:

    ...
    my $fail_reason = do_something_that_may_fail();
    return emit_fail {-reason => $fail_reason}
        if $fail_reason;
    ...

=head3 shows_progress

=over

=item I<shows_progress> option to C<new>

=item get method: C<< $crier->shows_progress() >>

=item set methods: C<< $crier->show_progress >> and C<< $crier->hide_progress >>

=back

This attribute determines whether C<< $cry->over >> and C<< $cry->prog >> 
display anything. If false, these don't do anything. This is useful
for turning these off via the command line, especially in circumstances 
where certain dumb IDE consoles can't backspace.

=head3 silent

=over

=item I<silent> option to C<cry>

=back

Set this option to a true value to have the cry both begin and close out 
silently. It will not display the opentext, and it will set the I<muted> 
option for this cry.

It might seem pointless, but since C<text> calls are only valid inside a cry,
a silent cry is the only way to allow for C<text> calls before any cry is issued.

=head3 step

=over

=item I<step> option to C<new>

=item get methods: C<< $crier->step >>

=item set methods: C<< $crier->set_step >>

=back

Sets the indentation step size (number of spaces) for nesting messages.
The default is 2.
Set to 0 to disable indentation - all messages will be left justified.
Set to a small positive integer to use that step size.


=head3 timestamp

=over

=item I<timestamp> option to C<new>, C<cry>, or C<done> or equivalents

=item get methods: C<timestamp> (on either $crier or $cry)

=item set methods: C<set_timestamp> (on either $crier or $cry)

=back

If false (the default), output lines are not prefixed with a
timestamp.  If true, the default local timestamp HH::MM::SS is
prefixed to each line.  If it's a coderef, then that function is
called to get the timestamp string.  The function is passed the
current indent level, for what it's worth.  Note that no delimiter
is provided between the timestamp string and the emitted line, so
you should provide your own (a space or colon or whatever).  Also,
C<text> output is NOT timestamped, just the opening and closing
text.

=head3 trailer

=over

=item I<trailer> option to C<new>, C<cry>, or C<done> or equivalents

=item get methods: C<trailer> (on either $crier or $cry)

=item set methods: C<set_trailer> (on either $crier or $cry)

=back

The single character used to trail after a message up to the
completion severity. It must be one column wide.

The default is the dot (the period, ".").  Here's what messages
look like if you change it to an underscore:

  The code:
    my $crier = Actium::O::Crier::->new({trailer =>'_'});
    $crier->cry("Doing something");

  The output:
    Doing something...______________________________ [DONE]

Note that the ellipsis after the message is still "...";
use I<ellipsis> to change that string as well.

Setting the trailer attribute on a cry will affect only that cry.
Setting it in a C<done> call or equivalent, or using a C<set_trailer>
on an already opened cry, will affect only the close of that cry.

Setting the trailer attribute on a crier will affect all
future cries.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 'Cry error (cry object not saved)'

The C<cry> method was called in void context. This creates
an object which should be saved to a variable.
See L<< /$crier->cry() >>.

=head2 Arguments given in "use Actium::O::Crier (default_crier => {args})" but the default crier has already been initialized

A module attempted to set attributes to the default crier in the import
process, but the default crier can only be created once. 
(You can use methods to set all attributes to the default crier, with the
exception of the filehandle.)

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

At the moment, it relies on a number of Actium modules
as well as core modules in Perl 5.016.
Other dependencies include:

=over

=item Moose

=item Sub::Exporter

=item Term::ANSIColor (required only if colorizing)

=item Unicode::LineBreak

=item Unicode::GCString

=back

=head1 NOTES

Actium::O::Crier is a fork of Term::Emit, by Steve Roscio.
Term::Emit is great, but it is dependent on Scope::Upper, which hasn't always
compiled cleanly in my installation, and also Term::Emit uses a number of
global variables, which save typing but mean that its objects aren't
self-contained. Actium::O::Crier is designed to do a lot of what
Term::Emit does, but in a somewhat cleaner way, even if it means there's a bit
more typing involved.

Actium::O::Crier does use Moose, which is somewhat odd for a
command-line program. Since many other Actium programs also use Moose,
this is a relatively small loss in this case. If this ever becomes
a separate distribution it should probably use something else, such as Moo.
