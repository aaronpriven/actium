# Trip collection object (for schedules)

# legacy status 4

package Actium::O::Sked::TripCollection 0.010;

# This is a collection of trips. It is convenient to have a collection of trips
# object (separate from the Sked object) for two reasons. First, the collection
# can be immutable even if the trips inside it, and the schedule, are mutable,
# so we can store things like the routes of all trips in it even if the trips
# themselves may change.  Second, it allows what had been class methods 
# working on groups of trips to be object methods on the collection object.
