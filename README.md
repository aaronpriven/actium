# What is Actium?

Actium is a project to release publicly some code and data used to
create public information materials for [AC Transit](http://www.actransit.org)
(online timetables, printed schedules at stops) using a series of Perl
programs, Applescript programs, FileMaker databases and 
InDesign documents.

What's here now is (almost entirely) just the Perl programs, which
I am slowly reorganizing and rewriting. It is not ready yet for
anybody else to use, but perhaps those who are interested can at
least see what it looks like.

Many of our graphics files are available at 
[our Pixelapse account](https://www.pixelapse.com/ACTransit_Svc_Info).
