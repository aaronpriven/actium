package Octium::Eclipse 0.012;

# Originally, this did nothing of any use. However, requiring that this file
# be present was a cute way of figuring out whether the requiring
# program is running under Eclipse or not.

# Add -MOctium::Eclipse to Eclipse's default perl comamnd line.
# Then you can do:

#  if ($Octium::Eclipse::is_under_eclipse) {
#     do_something();
#  }
#  else {
#     do_something_else;
#  }

# Ta da.

# Originally, I did that so that actium.pl could ask for a command line if
# none was provided.  I later moved that routine to this module. So
# Octium::Eclipse::get_command_line() gets the command line (using Applescript...
# slowly) from Eclipse.
