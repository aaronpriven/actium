=head1 NAME

Actium::O::Time - Routines to format times in the Actium system

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium::O::Time version 0.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::O::Time;
 my $time = Actium::O::Time->from_str('8:15a');
 my $time2 = Actium::O::Time->from_num(  65 ); # 1:05 am
 my $negtime = Actium::O::Time->from_str("23'59");
 my @moretimes = Actium::O::Time->from_str('12:15p', '2015', '12:01x');
 
 say $time->ap;      # 12:15a
 say $negtime->ap;   # 11:59p
 say $negtime->apbx; # 11:59b
 say $time->t24;     # 00:15
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::O::Time is an class designed to format times for transit schedules.
It takes times formatted in a number of different ways and converts them
to a number of minutes after midnight (or, if negative, before midnight).
Times are only treated as whole minutes, so seconds are not used.

Most transit operators that run service after midnight treat those trips as 
a later part of the service day: so a trip that begins at 1:00 a.m. on Sunday 
is scheduled as though it were at 25 o'clock on Saturday. This class allows 
times from noon on the day before the service day through 11:59 on the day
after the service day (so for a Saturday day of service, from 12:00 p.m. Friday
through 11:59 a.m. Sunday). 
(Noon on the following day is also accepted as a special case.)

The object allows times in different formats to be normalized and output
in various other formats, as well as allowing sorting of times numerically.

This uses "flyweight" objects, meaning that it returns the same object
every time you pass particular arguments to construct it.  These objects
are immutable.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

The object is constructed using C<< Actium::O::Time->from_str >>
or C<< Actium::O::Time->from_num >>

=over

=item B<< Actium::O::Time->from_str( I<string> , I<string>, ...) >>

This constructor accepts times represented as a string, usually a formatted
time such as "11:59a" or "13'25".

There are a limited number of special cases where names are used for times
instead of a format string. The valid named times are:

=over

=item    NOON_YESTERDAY

=item    MIDNIGHT

=item    NOON

=item    MIDNIGHT_TOMORROW 

=item    NOON_TOMORROW 

=back 

(The named format is the only way to specify noon tomorrow with a string.)

Otherwise, the string format can be one of three:

=over 

=item 1

<hours><minutes><am/pm>

=item 2

<optional negative sign><hours><minutes>

=item 3

<hours><apostrophe><minutes>

=back

Most characters, including common separators (colons, periods, spaces, commas) 
and the 
final "m" are filtered out before determining which format applies.
This makes it easy to submit "8:35 a.m." if you receive times in
that format; it will be converted to '835a' before processing.

All three formats require a leading zero on the minutes, but not
on the hours.

The first format accepts hours from 1 to 12, and minutes from 00 to 59. 

The second format accepts any number of hours from -11 to 35. Minutes 
still must be from 00 to 59. If a negative sign is given, these are treated 
as times before midnight, so -0:01 is the same as "11:59b" 
(i.e., 11:59 yesterday).

The third format accepts hours from 12 to 23. It is treated as though
it were the time on the day before midnight, so "23'59" is treated as
meaning, one minute before today's midnight.

For the first format, a final "a" is accepted for a.m. times, and
a final "p" for p.m. times. 

Two other final letters are accepted.

A final "b" is accepted for times before midnight, so '1159b' is 
treated as one minute before midnight.

A final "x" is accepted for times after midnight on the following day, so 
'1201x' is treated as one minute after midnight, tomorrow.

(Note that "12:00z" is not accepted for noon tomorrow, although the module
can output that format from C<apbx>.)

As a special case, if there are no numbers in the string at all, it represents
a null time. This is used for blank columns in schedules.

=item B<< Actium::O::Time->from_num( I<integer>, I<integer>, ... ) >>

This constructor accepts a time number: an integer representing
the number of minutes after midnight (or, if negative, before
midnight). 

The integer must be between -720 and 2160, representing the times between
noon yesterday and noon tomorrow.

=item B<< Actium::O::Time->new() >>

B<< Do not use this method. >>

This method is used internally by Actium::O::Time to create a new object and
insert it into the caches used by C<from_str> and C<from_num>. 
There should never be a reason
to create more than one object with the same arguments.

=item B<Actium::O::Time::->timesort(I<obj>, I<obj>, ...>

This class method takes a series of Actium::O::Time objects and sorts them
(numerically according to their time number value), returning the 
sorted list of objects. 

=back

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over

=item B<timenum()>

Returns the time as a number of minutes since midnight (or, if negative, before
midnight).

=item B<ap()>

Returns the time as a string: hours, a colon, minutes, followed by "a" for a.m.
or "p" for p.m. For example, "2:25a" or "11:30p".

=item B<apbm()>

Like C<ap()>, except that noon is returned as "12:00n" and midnight is returned
as "12:00m".

=item B<apbx()>

Returns the time as a string: hours, a colon, minutes, followed by marker. 
Times today are given the marker "a" for a.m. or "p" for p.m. Times tomorrow
are given the marker "x" and times yesterday are given the marker "b".
For example, "11:59b" is yesterday, one minute before midnight and 
"12:01x" is tomorrow, one minute after midnight. 

(There is one additional
marker, "z", which is only used for noon tomorrow. Times after noon tomorrow
are invalid, but the time noon tomorrow is used as a highest-possible-time, 
so that is a valid object, although it should probably not be displayed.)

=item B<t24()>

Returns the time as a 24-hour string: hours (padded with a leading zero if
necessary), a colon, and minutes.  The day is not given (so yesterday's and 
tomorrow's times are shown as if they were today's).
