=head1 NAME

Octium::Sked::StopTrip - Object representing a trip in a stop schedule

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Octium::Sked::StopTrip;
 my $trip = Octium::Sked::StopTrip->new(
    time              => '5:15a',
    line              => '40',
    place_in_effect  => '12BD',
    'at_place'        => 1,
    destination_place => '11JE',
    days              => '12345',
    next_place        => '11JE',
    ensuingstops           => [qw/51528 51110/],
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that represents a single trip in a schedule for a
stop.  It is created using Moose.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

This is the constructor for the object, inherited from Moose.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 time

This is an L<Actium::Time|Actium::Time> object. If the constructor is
passed a string, will use the C<from_str> method of Actium::Time to get
an object. Required.

=head2 line

A string representing a bus line designation. Required.

=head2 place_in_effect

A string representing the ID of the place (timepoint) of this stop, or
the  previous place, if this stop is between places.

=head2 next_place

A string representing the ID of the place (timepoint) following this
stop. If this stop is the destination place, will be the empty string.

=head2 destination_place

A string representing the ID of the place (timepoint) of the final
stop. Required.

=head2 days

An L<Octium::Days|Octium::Days> object. If passed a string, will send
that to C<Octium::Days->instance>. Required.

=head2 calendar_id

A string representing a calendar ID, from the calendars imported with
this booking.

=head2 ensuingstops

An
L<Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops|Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops>
object, which represents all the subsequent stops after the one on this
trip. If passed an array reference of stop IDs, will create an object
from that. Required.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_at_place

Returns true if this stop is at the current place, false if it is
between places.

=head2 is_final_stop

Returns true if this stop is the final stop, false otherwise.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None specific to this module, but see L<Actium|Actium> and
L<Moose|Moose>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The Actium system.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
