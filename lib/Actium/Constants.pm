=head1 NAME

Actium::Constants - constants used across Actium modules

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Actium::Constants version 0.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::Constants;
 $new_string = join($SPACE , @whatever) . $CRLF;
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports a series of constant values used by various Actium
modules.  They will be exported by default and are also available using
the fully-qualified form, e.g.,  $Actium::Constants::CRLF .

=head1 CONSTANTS

=over

=item $EMPTY_STR

=item $EMPTY

The empty string.

=item $CR

A carriage return.

=item $LF

A line feed.

=item $CRLF

A carriage return followed by a line feed ("\r\n").

=item $TAB

A tab.

=item $SPACE

A space.

=item $DQUOTE

A double quote (useful for interpolation).

=item $VERTICALTAB

A vertical tab, used to separate multiline fields in FileMaker.

=item $KEY_SEPARATOR

This contains the C<^]> character (ASCII 29, "Group Separator"), which
is used by FileMaker to separate entries in repeating fields. It is
also used by various Actium routines to separate values, e.g., the
Hastus Standard AVL routines use it in hash keys when two or more
values are needed to uniquely identify a record. (This is the same
basic idea as that intended by perl's C<$;> variable [see
L<perlvar/$;>].)

=item $MINS_IN_12HRS

The number of minutes in 12 hours (12 times 60, or 720).

=item %LINES_TO_COMBINE

This contains a hard-wired hash of lines. Each key is a line that
should be consolidated with another line on its schedule: for example,
59A should appear with 59, and 72M should appear with 72. It is not
possible to simply assume that a line should appear with all its
subsidiary lines since some lines do not fit this pattern (386 and 83
go on 86 while 72R does not go on 72).

This is not the right place to store this information;  it should be
moved to a user-accessible database.

=item @SCHEDULE_DAYS

This is a list of valid schedule day codes. Each set of schedules is
either the set of schedules for weekdays (WD), Saturdays (SA), or
Sundays (SU). Sometimes these can be combined, so we have combinations:
weekends (WE), and every day (DA). For completeness we also have
weekdays and Saturdays (WA) and weekdays and Sundays (WU), although
usage is expected to be extremely rare.

These originate from the old transitinfo.org web site, which many years
ago helped parse the schedules. That went away a long time ago, but the
codes live on.

=item @DIRCODES

Direction codes (northbound, southbound, etc.)  The original few were
based on transitinfo.org directions, but have been extended to include
kinds of directions that didn't exist back then.

=item @HASTUS_DIRS

Numeric directions from Hastus, in the same order as @DIRCODES (so
@DIRCODES[5] is the same direction as @HASTUS_DIRS[5]).

=item @LOOP_DIRECTIONS

=item %IS_A_LOOP_DIRECTION

Those directions that are loops: counterclockwise and clockwise, and A
and B. The hash version just allows an easy "is this a loop direction"
lookup.

=item @TRANSBAY_NOLOCALS

Transbay lines where local riding is prohibited. This should be moved 
to a database.

=item @LINES_TO_BE_SKIPPED

=item %LINE_SHOULD_BE_SKIPPED

Lines that should not be used at all. This should be moved to a
database.  The hash version just allows an easy "should this line be
skipped" lookup.

=item %SIDE_OF

Of city codes, "E" if it's in the East Bay, "W" for the West Bay. Used
for  determining whether "Transbay Passengers Only" needs to be  put on
flags, among other things. Should be replaced with the "Side" value in 
the "Cities" table in the Actium database. (Perhaps should even be
replaced  by a more general fare-zone value associated with stops...)

=item @HASTUS_CITY_OF

City codes associated with Hastus. Should be replaced with the "Code"
value in the "Cities" table in the Actium database.

=item %PV_TYPE

A hash whose keys are all the various type values that are part of
Params::Validate's ":types" export tag (SCALAR, ARRAYREF, HASHREF,
etc.). This way it avoids polluting the namespace with all those very
generic  values, while still allowing the use of Params::Validate
types. (Which are not at all related to Moose types.)

See L<Params::Validate|Params::Validate> for details on the values and
their  meanings.
