... graph and topological sort. The Graph module is pretty easy to use:


use warnings;
use strict;
use Graph;

my $graph = Graph->new(directed => 1);
my $prev;
while (<DATA>) {
    chomp;
    $graph->add_edge($prev, $_) if length && length $prev;
    $prev = $_;
}
print $_,"\n" for $graph->topological_sort;

__DATA__
first
second
third
sixth
seventh
tenth

first
third
fourth
fifth
sixth

third
fifth
seventh
eighth
ninth
tenth

---

Output:

first
second
third
fourth
fifth
sixth
seventh
eighth
ninth
tenth
