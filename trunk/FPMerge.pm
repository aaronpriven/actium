# FPread can build two different data structures.
# It always builds an array in the anonymous space pointed to by
# the passed $fparray reference. If an index field is passed, it also
# builds a hash pointed to by $fphash.

# fparray looks like this:
# fparray[0..n]{$field} = "value"
# where 0..n is the number of the line in the file

# fphash looks like this:
# fphash{$indexfield}{$field} = "value"
# 
# If the index field isn't unique, all is not lost. The structure
# automagically changes to 
# fphash{$indexfield}[0..n]{$field} = "value"
#
# In any case, "value" can either be a single value, or -- if 
# FileMaker has put in ASCII 29 characters, meaning it's a repeated
# field in the FileMaker database -- an array of values.

# Although this routine handles non-unique index fields and
# repeating fields, it can't handle a repeating index field.
# How would that work anyway?

# @fparray and %fphash are filled with the same references -- so you can 
# manipulate references within @fparray and the data in %fphash will be changed.
