=head1 NAME

Actium::Files::TabDelimited - Read tab-delimited files into perl data

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::Files::TabDelimited ('read_tab_files');
 
 my %data;
 
 my $callback = sub {
     $hashref = shift;
     while ( my ($key, $value) = each %{$hashref}) {
        push @{$data{$key}} , $value;
     }
 };
     
 read_tab_files(
    {   files     => ['*.txt'],
        folder           => $folder_obj,
        required_headers => ['ID','Name'],
        callback         => $callback,
    }
 );
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::Files::TabDelimited contains a routine to read tab-delimited files
from a directory, and return the data to the caller via a callback function.

It is designed to encapsulate some of the more tedious aspects of reading
tab-delimited files, such as determining the headers and providing terminal
feedback.

The program assumes that the first line of each file is a set of column
headings, and that values are separated by tabs.

The routine calls the callback on each line read. The callback is given
a series of arguments:

=over

=item * 

A reference to a hash whose keys are the column headers and whose values
are the values of each column.

=item *

A reference to an array of the values of each column.

=item *

A reference to an array of the column headers.

=item *

The line as read from the file.

=item * 

The file name of the current file.

=item *

The number of the current line being read in the file (beginning with 1).

=back

This allows the caller to save the data from the line in a variety of ways.

=head1 SUBROUTINE: read_tab_files()

The read_tab_files takes a series of named parameters. Parameter processing is
performed using Params::Validate, so the parameters can either be passed as
a hash or as a hash reference.

The named parameters are:

=over

=item folder

This mandatory parameter 
is intended to be an Actium::Folder object (or a subclass such
as Actium::Folders::Signup). However, any object representing a folder will 
work if it implements the methods "make_filespec", "glob_plain_files", 
"open_read", and "display_path." See L<Actium::Folder|Actium::Folder> for
details of these methods.

=item files

If present, this parameter must be a reference to an array of 
one or more names of files found in the folder given in the folder parameter. 

If neither files nor globpatterns is specified, an exception will be thrown.

=item globpatterns

If present, this parameter must be a reference to an array of one or
more patterns (to be passed to $folderobject->glob_plain_files ), which will
cause those files to be read.

If neither files nor globpatterns is specified, an exception will be thrown.

=item required_headers

If present, this parameter must be a reference to an array of column headers
to be found in the tab file. If any header is not found, an exception is
thrown.

=item progress_lines

If present, this parameter specifies after how many lines the progress 
indicator (percentages) are updated. The default is 5000.

=item callback

This mandatory parameter must be a code reference. For each line read, this
code reference is invoked, as described above.

=item trim

If present and true, this will trim whitespace from the beginning and end 
of each field. This can be time-consuming in a large file.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=item 'Must specify either files or globpatterns to read_tab_files'

read_tab_files was called, but the caller specified neither a list of files
nor a list of patterns that will be used to determine which files should
be called, so the routine didn't know which files to open.

=item "No files found in $path passed to read_tab_files "

No files were found, either from the files or globpatterns provided.

=item "Required header $required_header not found in file $file"

A header was passed via the "required_headers" parameter that was not found
in the file.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item *

Perl 5.014

=item *

Actium::Term

=item *

Actium::Util

=item *

Params::Validate

=item *

Sub::Exporter

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

A more flexible routine would also allow other line terminators than "\n". 

Some of the same code could be used for CSV files, where it would use 
Text::CSV to do the CSV parsing but would have the same calling syntax and
other features.
