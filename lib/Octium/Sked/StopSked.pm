=head1 NAME

Octium::Sked::StopSked - Object representing a schedules of a
particular stop

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Octium::Sked::StopSked;
 Octium::Sked::StopSked->new(...)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that represents a single schedule for a stop: the
trips on a line, in a direction, and on scheduled days, passing a
single stop.  It is created using Moose.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

The method inherits its constructor from Moose.

=head2 unbundle

 $stopsked = Octium::Sked::StopSked->unbundle($string);

The C<unbundle> method takes a string created by the C<bundle> method
and returns a recreated object.

=head2 merge 

 $merged = Octium::Sked::StopSked->merge(@stopskeds);

The C<merge> method takes two stop schedule objects and merges them
into a single object, with a combined set of trips.

The schedules must all be associated with the same stop ID.  The days
are set to be a union of all the associated schedules' days.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All attributes are required to be passed to the constructor.

=head2 stopid

A string, the stop ID of the represented stop.

=head2 days

An L<Octium::Days|Octium::Days> object representing the scheduled days
of service for this schedule. Required.  Uses coercions defined in
L<Actium::Types|Actium::Types>.

=head2 trips

An array of L<Octium::Sked::StopTrip|Octium::Sked::StopTrip> objects. 
It is expected to be passed in the order in which it will be displayed.
 The "trips" argument in the constructor should be a reference to the
array, while the trips() method will return the list.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 is_final_stop

True if this is the final stop of this schedule, false otherwise. (Only
true if it is the final stop of I<every> trip, not just some trips.)

=head2 bundle

This returns a string which, when passed to the C<unbundle> class
method, will recreate the object.

=head2 ensuing_count ($threshold)

Returns a hash reference. The key is a string, the result of
L<C<ensuing_str> in
Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops|Octium::Sked::StopTrip::EnsuingStops/ensuing_str>.
All trips with the same ensuing stops (up to $threshold, or all of them
if $threshold is omitted or 0) will have the same string.  The values
are the counts, the number of trips which will see those ensuing stops.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Can't merge schedules where stop IDs are different

The C<merge> method received schedules that didn't share a stop ID.
Merged schedules must share a stop ID.

=back

See alaso L<Actium|Actium> and L<Moose|Moose>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The Actium system.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

None known. Issues are tracked on Github at
L<https:E<sol>E<sol>github.comE<sol>aaronprivenE<sol>actiumE<sol>issues|https:E<sol>E<sol>github.comE<sol>aaronprivenE<sol>actiumE<sol>issues>.
