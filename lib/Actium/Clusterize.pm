=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::Clusterize combines lists of items into reasonably-sized
chunks.

The idea is that there are a certain number of items, each one divided
into a category that is an integer.  Maybe there are different zones of
bus stops, where each zone is given a number: zone 101, zone 102, zone
304, and so on.  If each zone has a significant number of stops that
need work, not much is needed: just make up a separate work order list
for each zone. But what if some zones only have one or two stops? A
separte work order for each stop is overkill.  This routine combines
small zones into larger ones.

The routine assumes that the numbers are hierarchies, and puts together
zones that start with the same numbers.  So, for example, it treats 502
and 5021 as more closely related than 502 and 503, or 5021 and 5120.
This is intentional, as it should make it easier (for example) to add
new  zones in between other zones, without having to rename them.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item B<clusterize()>

The B<clusterize> subroutine accepts named parameters. Either
C<count_of> or  C<items> must be specified. The other two parameters,
C<root_digits> and  C<size>, are optional.

=over 

=item C<count_of>

This should be a reference to a hash, where the keys are the zone
numbers and the values are the quantities in each zone.

 my $clusters_of_r = clusterize ( count_of => { 101 => 5, 102 => 2 } );
 
=item C<items>

This should be a reference to an array, each containing a zone number.

 my $clusters_of_r = clusterize ( items => { qw/101 101 101 101 101 102 102/);
     
The B<clusterize> subroutine will convert this into a count. Specify
whichever is easier.

=item C<root_digits> (default: 1)

The B<clusterize> routine does not combine zones that have different
roots. For example, using the default, it will never combine zones
beginning with 1 and zones beginning with 2, even if only one stop
begins with 1.  This parameter allows the number of digits treated as
root digits to be specified:

=over

0 -- All items could be combined.

1 -- Items 1000 and 1999 could be combined, but not items 1010 and
2010.

2 -- Items 1010 and 1020 could be combined, but not items 1010 and
1100, or items 1100 and 2100.

=back

And so forth.

=item C<size> (default: 40)

This is the number of items that's considered the minimum size for a
work  order.  Work zones with a quantity of items smaller than this
will be combined with other work zones (unless those work zones have
different roots).

So, for example,

 my $clusters_of_r = clusterize ( count_of => { 101 => 45, 102 => 42 } );
 
will yield C<{ 101 => 101, 102 = 102 }>, but

 my $clusters_of_r = clusterize ( 
      count_of => { 101 => 45, 102 => 42 } , size => 50);
      
will yield C<{ '101' => '101-102', '102' => '101-102' }>.

=back

The result from B<clusterize> will be a reference to a hash. The keys
will be the original items passed to B<clusterize>. The values will be
the new cluster that they are placed in, expressed as a combination of
ranges. So, for example,  a new cluster might be "101" where a single
work zone makes up a cluster, or "102-103" or even
"102-105,107-108,150-151" if that's the result.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 

=item *

Invalid root digit specification $root_digits

The root_digit parameter was not a number, or negative

=for removed

=item *

Longest leaf length (...) less than or equal to the number of root
digits specified (...)

The root digit specification was so big, and the longest leaf length so
small, that clusterization would be pointless as everything would be 
in its own cluster.

This is no longer valid as now clusters like this just return
themselves

=cut

=item * 

Cannot specify both count_of and items

=item *

Must specify either count_of or items

One, and only one, of C<count_of> or C<items> must be specified  to
B<clusterize>. If neither is specified, there's nothing to work on; if
both are specified, it's not clear which should be worked on.
