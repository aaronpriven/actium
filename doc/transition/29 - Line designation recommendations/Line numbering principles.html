<h1 class="title">Line Numbering Principles </h1>
</header>
<p>The most important thing about line numbers is that they are public
information: their purpose is to help customers use the transit system.
Line numbering should be focused on customers’ needs.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people to see apparently disordered line
numbering and assume that it is aimless, and that it would be better to
systematize the line numbers — so the numbers make it easier to
understand the transit system as a whole, or simply because order seems
better than disorder.</p>
<p>But, while there are exceptions, most transit riders do not use the
transit system as a whole. They use particular lines in particular
places, and making the numbers work as a system can actually make it
harder for people to use the small pieces of the network that they
typically use.</p>
<p>In 2000, AC Transit restructured lines in Fremont, and introduced a
series of line numbers for the new lines there. At Fremont BART, the
available lines were 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 217, 218, and 219. So
there was order. But it was very difficult to use, because all those
numbers were so similar that it was hard to remember which of them one
wanted. Was it the 215 or 217 that went along Mission Blvd.? Was it the
218 or 219 that served Thornton Blvd.? You had to check – not just at
the BART station, but anywhere in the system where two or more lines
came together. It was hard to remember and frustrating.</p>
<p>Customers use line numbers primarily to remember which line they are
supposed to take. Line numbering should be crafted in order to make this
task as easy as possible. And, in general, numbers should be chosen such
that the more people use a line, the easier that line number is to
remember.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a line is associated with a numbered street or highway, then
using that number for the line makes the number easy to remember: Line
98 runs on 98th Avenue.</p></li>
<li><p>People’s perception of number is logarithmic: small numbers seem
further apart than big numbers, so that “1” and “2” seem more different
than “225” and “226.” Numbers that are further apart are easier to
distinguish.</p>
<p>It follows that short numbers are easier to remember than longer
numbers, and that, all else being equal, lower two- and three-digit
numbers are easier to remember than higher two- and three-digit numbers.
The lines with the highest ridership should be given single-digit
numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Other numbers may also be more memorable than others. Which
numbers are most memorable is an empirical question that ideally should
be researched, but it’s probably a safe assumption that round numbers
(ending in 0) and numbers with repeated digits are relatively more
memorable.</p></li>
<li><p>One easy and common mistake is to confuse one line number with
another. Thus, line numbers should be chosen to be as different as
possible from other nearby line numbers. Ideally, a line’s number will
not share digits in the same places with nearby lines’ numbers (so 27
and 29 should not be nearby), or be the reverse of a nearby line (27 and
72 should not be nearby).</p></li>
<li><p>An exception is when two lines are very similar over a large part
of their travel, such that it is desirable to make them seem tied
together. In this case, two separate but similar numbers are preferred
(e.g., 20 and 21). Letter suffixes should be avoided for this
purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>It is confusing when the same line number refers to several
different things. Variants that take people different places should be
numbered differently. Short turns may not require a separate
designation, but significant branches and deviations should have a
separate number.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter suffixes should generally be used for service types (“L”
for limited, “R” for Rapid, “X” for express, etc.), not for
variants.</p></li>
<li><p>At AC Transit, the hundreds digit should be used primarily to
indicate the general time of day:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>300-series lines: atypical hours not otherwise assigned</p></li>
<li><p>600-series lines: school days and hours</p></li>
<li><p>800-series lines: All Nighter hours (primarily 1-5 a.m.)</p>
<p>An exception is that 400-series lines will be used for flexible
services.</p>
<p>The 200-series routes have been used to indicate a geographic area.
This is not helpful for customers, who already know whether they are
going to the Fremont/Newark area or not. The exclusive use of the
200-series to indicate a geographic region should be phased out, and all
line numbers from 1 through 299 made available for regular bus lines
districtwide, where low ridership would indicate the use of high
numbers.</p>
<p>(The 100-series is used internally, not publicly, for Transbay lines.
Line numbers in this series not currently used should be made available
for public use, and new internal-only line group numbers should use
900-series numbers.)</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>At AC Transit, letters should continue to be used publicly for
Transbay lines.</p></li>
<li><p>AC Transit should encourage harmonization of line numbering
between regional transit agencies, and promote these principles in any
such effort.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When lines are changed, numbers should be assigned such that
customers will not be surprised by the changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When lines are substantially rerouted, they should be given new
numbers. There is no bright-line rule for how much is substantial, but
the decision should consider numbers of passengers as well as distance.
It is better to ask people to learn a new line number than to have them
end up somewhere they didn’t expect because they got on a bus they
didn’t realize had changed.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, lines that are extended (without changing the
existing portion substantially) should keep the same number, even if
that extension is very long.</p></li>
<li><p>[2022 revision] Lines that are truncated should be renumbered if
the truncation is likely to cause people to end up in the wrong spot.
Most of the time, this is not the case – the best course of action for
someone riding a line that is now truncated is to ride as far as
possible, and then transfer to another line. But if the best course of
action is otherwise, the line should be renumbered to avoid
this.</p></li>
<li><p>Lines should not change numbers arbitrarily (that is, without a
corresponding change in the service).</p></li>
<li><p>Unless a discontinued line is revived, in which case it should
receive its old number if available, numbers should not be re-used for
two years after discontinuance. A decade or more should pass before the
same number is used for a different line in the same section of the
district.</p></li>
