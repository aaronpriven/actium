actium time -- convert timenums to timestrings

Usage:

actium time <time>...

Converts times (found on the command line) between a time number (an integer:
minutes after midnight, or before midnight if negative) to a time string
(hours:minutes), or vice versa.  Any integers are treated as time numbers;
anything else is treated as a time string.

Because command-line options are preceded by a hyphen, negative numbers require
special treatment.  Either precede all times with a double dash ("--"), which
indicates that following command-line arguments will not be processed as
options, or alternatively enter negative numbers with an "n" instead of a minus
sign ("n10" will be treated as -10).

=head1 NAME

act-pvt.pl time - convert between time numbers and strings

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 USAGE

 act-pvt.pl time 150
  # 150 -> AP: 2:30a or APBX: 2:30a or T24: 02:30

 act-pvt.pl time 2:30
  # 2:30 -> 150

 act-pvt.pl time 2:30p 3:30p
  # 2:30p -> 870

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<act-pvt.pl time> command converts between Actium time numbers and times
displayed in the conventional way (e.g., "3:15p").

Actium time numbers are integers representing the number of minutes since
midnight on the start of that service day.  It is possible to have negative
integers, which represent times on the previous service day (so -15 is 
15 minutes before midnight).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Each argument is tested to see whether it is an integer. If it is, it is
treated as a time number, and a conversion made between that integer and
conventionally displayed times.  If it is not an integer, it is treated as a
conventional time, converted into an integer, and then displayed.

  1500 -> AP: 1:00a or APBX: 1:00x or T24: 01:00
  2:30p -> 870

The command accepts multiple arguments and will convert and display them, in
turn.

Because command-line options are preceded by a hyphen, negative numbers require
special treatment.  Either precede all times with a double dash ("--"), which
indicates that following command-line arguments will not be processed as
options, or alternatively enter negative numbers with an "n" instead of a minus
sign ("n10" will be treated as -10).

See the documentation of L<Actium::Time|Actium::Time> for full details about
what sorts of arguments are accepted as time strings.
