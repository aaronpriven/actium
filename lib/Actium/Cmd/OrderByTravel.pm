actium orderbytravel -- create list of stops ordered by travel route

Usage:

actium orderbytravel <file>

Takes the file specified as input. Takes everything before the first tab
as the Stop ID.  Reads the line.storable file from the specified signup and
produces a list of the input stops ordered by travel along the bus stops.

=head1 NAME

orderbytravel - produce ordered list of stops by travel along bus
routes

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.009

=head1 USAGE

From a shell:

 actium.pl orderbytravel /Some/Directory/Inputfile.txt

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item I<file>

The user must give the full pathname to an input file. The input file
is treated as tab-delimited text, with the first field being the stop
ID.

If the first field of a line is 'PhoneID', 'StopID', or 'stop_id_1', 
the line is skipped (since it probably contains column names).

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

This program specifies two options itself.

=over

=item B<-promote>

If present, this option must be followed by a list of lines, separated
by commas (and no spaces). For example,

  actium orderbytravel -promote 26,A,58 file.txt

These lines will be given precedence when choosing which line to use
for a particular stop, even if another line has more stops.

=item B<-demote600s>

If this option is given, all other lines will be given precedence over
lines 600-699, even if a 600-series line has more stops.

=back

Also, several modules this subprogram  uses specify options. See:

=over

=item L<OPTIONS in Actium::Cmd::Config::Signup|Actium::Cmd::Config::Signup/OPTIONS>

=back

A complete list of options can be found by running  "actium.pl help
orderbytravel"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this program is to produce lists of stops ordered by
travel  route. This makes it easier for a maintenance worker or
surveyor to travel down a bus route and visit all the stops, but
without duplicates.

The user specifies an input file which contains stops. The program
compares this to the 'line.storable' file, which contains a list of bus
lines and directions and which stops, in order, are used by those
lines.

The result is a list of routings, with the affected stops, with all
duplicates removed. It is designed so that the longest lists possible
are given.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item No input file given

No file specification was given on the command line.

=item Can't open file $inputfilespec: $OS_ERROR

An error was found trying to open the file given on the command line.
The file may not have been found, or there may be some other error.

=item Can't open line.storable file: $OS_ERROR

An error was found trying to read the file line.storable. It may not be
 present in the appropriate place (the "slists" folder under the
specified  signup) or there may be some other error.
