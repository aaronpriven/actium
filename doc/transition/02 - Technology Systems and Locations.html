<h1 class="title">2. Technology Systems and Locations</h1>
</header>
<p>Over the years I have put together a series of systems that create
passenger information products. I could not have created the products I
did without a substantial amount of automation. However, the systems are
generally out of date, and many of the products themselves are badly in
need of redesign. It would be possible for people who have knowledge of
Perl, FileMaker and InDesign/Illustrator scripting to keep these systems
going while incrementally upgrading them to be modern and robust. But at
this point, it seems like a bad idea to try to keep this alive rather
than replace it thoroughly with modern software that&#39;s built in a way
that&#39;s consistent with other AC Transit systems.</p>
<p>In short: Nobody thinks these systems are worth saving, even me. I&#39;ll
write about them to explain what they do and how they work. If someone
thinks it&#39;s important to keep them alive to make it through the current
quarter, I hope this will help them do that. But the programs should be
replaced, or eliminated.</p>
<h1 id="locations">Locations</h1>
<p>There are several basic systems that I use to create passenger
information: the FileMaker database, the perl programs, and
InDesign/Illustrator scripts, which are located in different places.
Together, they are loosely called “Actium” (the first three letters are
“ACT” for AC Transit, and looking at words that began with those
letters, I picked “Actium,” the name of an ancient battle that led to
the Roman Empire).</p>
<h2 id="github">Github</h2>
<p>There is a Github repository at
https://github.com/aaronpriven/actium. The perl programs have always
been there, and as a part of transition I added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a “clone” of the FileMaker database (a copy with the data
removed, but with the database structure, scripts, and layouts
intact)</p></li>
<li><p>an export of the full data in CSV form</p></li>
<li><p>text versions of all the InDesign/Illustrator scripts</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mac-mini-server">Mac Mini Server</h2>
<p>Except for the InDesign / Illustrator scripts, most of the programs
are run on a Mac Mini Server (Mid-2011 model). It is running macOS High
Sierra (10.13). This computer cannot run a newer OS than this, but it&#39;s
kept around mainly because FIleMaker 14 is a 32-bit program and will not
run on recent versions of macOS.</p>
<h2 id="actium.ini">.actium.ini</h2>
<p>The perl programs read a file called .actium.ini in the user’s home
folder, which is a regular Windows-style .ini configuration file. A copy
of mine is found in the transition folder (with the name
“dot-actium.ini” since I figured actually putting the dot in front –
typical for settings file in Unix systems – would be counterproductive).
The most important one to modify is the “base” under “Signup”, which
indicates where the signup folders are to be found. On my system the
actual folder is
“~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SharedLibraries-Alameda-ContraCostaTransit/PubInfSys
- Documents/Actium/signups” which is a mouthful. I usually make a
symlink ~/si pointing to it, and a symlink ~/p pointing to
“~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SharedLibraries-Alameda-ContraCostaTransit/PubInfSys
- Documents/”</p>
<h2 id="onedrive-sharepoint">OneDrive / Sharepoint</h2>
<p>Many of the files are located in the “<a href="https://actrans.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/PubInfSys/Shared%20Documents/Actium?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=cfh5AW">Actium</a>”
folder in the “PubInfSys” documents library on OneDrive / Sharepoint.
This includes the “signup folder” with the schedules for each signup
(booking), and most of the other files. For historical reasons (because
for a while they were stored separately), some of the templates for the
artwork is located in other folders of the “PubInfSys” documents
library.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more important locations in the “PubInfSys –
Documents” library.</p>
<h3 id="signup-folders">Signup folders</h3>
<p>/Actium/signups is the folder that contains data relating to each
signup (schedules, stop lists, etc.) They’re given names like “su22” for
Summer 2022, “f22” for Fall 2022, etc. There are separate folders for
Dumbarton service and Flex service. (A p at the end, like f22p, means
it’s preliminary data.) At this point I’ve kept a number of old signups
in there (such as “sp20”, the last pre-pandemic service).</p>
<p>The contents have changed over time so I’ll describe the current
signup, f22.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/cleverworks – This is where the program that
creates the CleverWorks import files looks for its data</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/compare – This is where stop and schedule
comparison reports are found, as well as written pieces describing those
differences</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/hasi – Some of the programs were written to use
the Hastus Standard AVL Export as their input. The program that imports
the new signups creates these from the Enterprise Database import so
that those programs can use them.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/idpoints2016 – These are InDesign Tagged Text
files that contain the schedules for each pole schedule or shelter
insert. They are created by “actium.pl makepoints”</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/p – These are files that contain just the
schedule data for each stop, without any of the formatting used by
InDesign. They are created by “actium.pl sked2points” and used by
“actium.pl makepoints”</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/pointlist – These are lists of the point
schedules (pole schedules and shelter inserts). Each run of “actium.pl
makepoints” makes a file called pl.&lt;something&gt;.txt, which then is
used by the Applescript makepoints.app program to make the actual sign
artwork in InDesign. There are also checklist spreadsheets for each run
and instruction spreadsheets designed to be imported into WorkLog.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/s – Contains the actual schedule data. The
schedule files are stored as Excel files, although for speed some of the
programs read a version of the objects saved in a Perl internal format
(the file is skeds.storable). The initial schedules are created by
“actium.pl xhea2skeds” and are stored in /Actium/signups/f22/s/received.
Then I make a set of modified versions in
/Actium/signups/f22/s/exceptions (where the import routine didn’t get it
quite right, or for other reasons) and these are assembled into the
final set stored in /Actium/signups/f22/s/exceptions. Within each of
those folders, the main “skeds” folder contains the actual data that’s
used for other programs (files like 19_EB_67H.xlsx). There are also
schedule data that’s exported in other versions, most usefully “place”,
which has times only for timepoints, not for all stops.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/signart – this is where the Applescript
makepoints.app program stores the resulting pole schedule and shelter
insert artwork.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/slists – This contains the lists of stops, by
pattern and then by “line” (really, by direction, e.g., all northbound
stops or eastbound stops combined). These are made by “actium.pl
avl2stoplists”.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/timetables – This contains the information used
for the printable PDF timetables. The folder pub-idtags contains the
InDesign Tagged Text files used by make_timetable.scpt. That script
saves the finished public timetables in
/Actium/signups/f22/timetables/tableart, although as part of exporting
them I move them to /Actium/tableart instead.</p>
<p>/Actium/signups/f22/xhea – This is where the Enterprise Database
Export files go. The tab-delimited results from “actium.pl newsignup”
are in /Actium/signups/f22/xhea/tab</p>
<h3 id="other-folders-in-actium">Other folders in /Actium</h3>
<p>/Actium/Applications – the AppleScript programs are located here.</p>
<p>/Actium/database – This contains older database files (the real one
is located on the Mac Mini server) and also some experiments at
replacing it with something else.</p>
<p>/Actium/documentation – Various documentation, mostly old and out of
date. As I go through this I’ll copy over the stuff that still seems
relevant to the folder where this is located.</p>
<p>/Actium/flagart/Decals/export – location of the exported flag decal
artwork (this folder used for placing into flags in InDesign, when
preparing whole flags for printing)</p>
<p>/Actium/flagart/Decals/export_bleed – location of the exported flag
decal artwork (this folder used for sending to the print shop and making
decals to be placed on flags)</p>
<p>/Actium/signart2016/maps – Contains the maps that are placed into the
pole schedules and shelter inserts. The “makepoints” program looks for
the exported PDF maps in /Actium/signart2016/maps/export when making
pole schedules.</p>
<p>/Actium/subsidiary – This contains artwork that is placed inside the
point schedule files. This hasn’t been culled in 20+ years so contains a
lot of stuff that isn’t used anymore. Most of the actual files that are
used are in the /AtStopSchedules folder.</p>
<p>/Actium/tableart – This contains the files used for printable PDF
timetables.</p>
<p>/Actium/tableart/CoverPages – Exported PDF versions of the cover
pages for each timetable.</p>
<p>/Actium/tableart/indd – Archive of old timetables, going back years
now.</p>
<p>/Actium/tableart/pdf – Exported PDF timetables. The important one is
/Actium/tableart/pdf/oneline-dates, which are the files that need to be
uploaded to the web server.</p>
<h3 id="other-folders-in-pubinfsys-documents">Other folders in
“PubInfSys – Documents”</h3>
<p>There are a lot of these folders and many of them are just old
projects or other things that don’t require a lot of knowledge transfer.
But some of them do.</p>
<p>/AtStopSchedules – This contains the templates used by the
Applescript makepoints program to create the pole schedules and shelter
inserts. “Templates” contains the templates themselves, while
“Subsidiary” has other documents that are placed inside those InDesign
files (fare information, header images, etc.)</p>
<p>/Cleverworks is mostly archival information about CleverWorks – the
information that’s used is mostly in the signup directory.</p>
<p>/Flags contains the InDesign artwork for flags, decals, service
change bag decals, and zip-tie sign decals.</p>
<p>/Flags/Bags contains templates for service change bags. Most service
change bags are made up manually, but when we’ve had major service
changes, I’ve created bags in bulk, using these templates.</p>
<p>/Flags/Decals contains the current decals (new map colors). Previous
versions of decals are also present.</p>
<p>/Flags/Flag Artwork contains the current base artwork for flags
(blank flags without lines).</p>
<p>/Flags/TempSigns contains templates for various sizes of laminated
signs to be zip-tied to poles, as well as the artwork for the preprinted
signs we’ve given to Supervision. (I’ve always felt the smaller 5.5 x 17
signs stayed on the poles better and were less likely to flop around and
look unprofessional than the 11 x 17 signs we usually use, but
whatever.)</p>
<p>/Maps contains all the different line and system map projects. Most
of them are just folders of documents, but there are a few that are
special.</p>
<p>/Maps/Repository contains a repository of line maps, mostly complete
from about 2006-ish, but with some older ones. Although it’s maintained
by some programs, there’s nothing special about the folder except that
it has a naming convention.</p>
<p>/Maps/Schematics is similar to /Maps/Repository except that it
contains a series of schematic maps that our cartographers produced for
the Training and Education Department in the 2008-2010 time frame (until
budget cuts forced their discontinuance).</p>
<p>/Passenger Information contains some documentation I wanted to make
more widely available. Some of this is still applicable.</p>
<p>/PubTimetables contains the templates and un-exported artwork for the
printable PDF timetables.</p>
<p>In addition to the “PubInfSys – Documents” library, there is also
“PubInfSys – Archive library” which contains much old information.</p>
<h1 id="systems">Systems</h1>
<h2 id="filemaker-database">FileMaker database</h2>
<p>The FileMaker database is called &quot;ACTransit_Actium.fmp12&quot;. It is
currently set up to be loaded on a copy of FileMaker Pro 14, which is
located on our Mac Mini server</p>
<p>The FileMaker database used to be stored on a hosted server, which we
paid for. Unfortunately FileMaker 15 did not support shared hosting in
the way that FileMaker 14 did, so when that came out, I moved the file
onto a copy of FileMaker Pro 14.</p>
<p>These are the tables in the FileMaker database. Back in 2014 I wrote
some documentation on the table and field descriptions that were done at
that time, called “ActiumExports – Table and Field Definitions.docx” – I
believe all the information in there is still accurate, although now
incomplete. I’ve copied it into the Transition folder.</p>
<h3 id="agencies">Agencies</h3>
<p>This table shows information about the three agencies that are part
of the at-stop schedule program: AC Transit, Broadway Shuttle, and
Dumbarton Express.</p>
<h3 id="cities">Cities</h3>
<p>Information about the cities, including the jurisdiction code in
Hastus and what the legal requirement for the “no smoking” text is.</p>
<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>
<p>Information about the colors used for lines (the color name, the CMYK
and RGB values, etc)</p>
<h3 id="fmtablekeys">FMTableKeys</h3>
<p>Metadata – the primary key for each FileMaker table.</p>
<h3 id="flagtypes">Flagtypes</h3>
<p>Sizes and types of flag artwork. Only used for automatically making
large numbers of flags, which we haven’t done in a while. (Most new
flags, when they have to be laid out, are done by just placing the
appropriate art in InDesign)</p>
<h3 id="i18n">I18N</h3>
<p>Snippets of translated text: e.g., the tag “we_only” is associated
with “Weekends only”, “S&lt;0x00F3&gt;lo los fines de semana”, and
“&lt;0x4EC5&gt;&lt;0x9650&gt;&lt;0x5468&gt;&lt;0x672B&gt;”. The hex
codes are Unicode values in the format that InDesign uses.</p>
<h3 id="linegrouptypes">LineGroupTypes</h3>
<p>Colors and sort values for line types such as Local, Transbay, Early
Bird, etc.</p>
<h3 id="lines">Lines</h3>
<p>One of the main tables, it includes information on each line: whether
it’s active, what it’s color is, what agency it’s associated with, its
description, and the transit hubs served.</p>
<h3 id="poi_stops_join">POI_Stops_Join</h3>
<p>A join table for PoIs and Stops_Neue. Not used.</p>
<h3 id="places_neue">Places_Neue</h3>
<p>Information about timepoints (“places” in Hastus). The name of the
place and the destination associated with each one.</p>
<h3 id="pois">PoIs</h3>
<p>Points of Interest. Not used.</p>
<h3 id="signlog">SignLog</h3>
<p>This contains the log entries for what at-stop schedule signs were
printed.</p>
<h3 id="signtemplates">SignTemplates</h3>
<p>Contains information on each template page (InDesign parent page) in
the at-stop schedule templates. Lists the number of columns and lengths
of each column.</p>
<h3 id="signtypes">SignTypes</h3>
<p>Contains information on each template file – each SignTemplate is
associated with one SignType. Numbers and lengths of columns in this
file are no longer used – instead it uses the values from the
SignTemplates table.</p>
<h3 id="signs">Signs</h3>
<p>This is the table that contains information about each at-stop
schedule (shelter insert, pole schedule, etc.) Is that sign active, what
stop is it associated with, etc.</p>
<h3 id="signs_stops_join">Signs_Stops_Join</h3>
<p>A join table between Signs and Stops. Signs can be located at a stop
and take schedules from that stop, or can take schedules from multiple
stops, in which case it is placed in this table.</p>
<h3 id="stops_neue">Stops_Neue</h3>
<p>Information about each stop. “ActiumExports – Table and Field
Definitions.docx” has the information about what the leading letter at
the beginning of each column name means.</p>
<h3 id="transithubs">TransitHubs</h3>
<p>Information about the transit centers associated with each line</p>
<h3 id="zipcodes">ZipCodes</h3>
<p>The crew assignment this once supported is no longer used</p>
<h3 id="annu">annu </h3>
<p>This associates the tag in CleverWorks for an audio file
(“annu_audios”) with text that, when found on a sign, should trigger
that text to be played (“annu_sign_text”).</p>
<h1 id="perl-programs">Perl programs</h1>
<p>The perl programs were written over many years. Some aren’t used
anymore; others have been heavily modified over the years; others, like
the Clever ones, were written recently and are still used regularly.</p>
<p>I was hoping to be able to rewrite the programs. As such, there is a
library folder called “Actium,” which consists of rewritten programs,
and one called “Octium,” meaning old-Actium, which consists of old
programs. Nearly everything is still in Octium.</p>
<p>Instructions for installing Perl on a Mac are here: <a href="https://github.com/aaronpriven/actium/blob/main/doc/Perl_installation.md">https://github.com/aaronpriven/actium/blob/main/doc/Perl_installation.md</a></p>
<p>I haven’t needed to do it lately, though.</p>
<p>Most programs access the FileMaker database using ODBC (one has to
install “unixodbc” before installing the CPAN “DBD::ODBC” module, and
then set up the FileMaker ODBC driver on the Mac using the free ODBC
Manager), and the files in the current signup folder.</p>
<p>The programs depends on many libraries from CPAN (cpan.org). I listed
them in the file “found-dependencies.txt” in the repository. However,
that’s created by looking for a tag that’s placed manually, and I may
have forgotten to add it to some dependencies.</p>
<p>Here I’m just going to describe each program briefly. I wrote this
but I’m not sure how useful it will be to answer “what is this program?”
or “what is this table?” I suspect it will be more useful for me to
describe each project, which I’ll do in another document.</p>
<p>Except for “actium.pl”, none of the programs are actually in the
“bin” folder. They’re stored as modules in the “lib/Octium/Cmd” folder.
The programs are run using “actium.pl” and then the name of the program,
e.g., “actium.pl actiumdbfields” runs the actiumdbfields program.</p>
<h3 id="actiumdbexport">actiumdbexport</h3>
<p>Exports all data from the FileMaker database to CSV files.</p>
<h3 id="actiumdbfields">actiumdbfields</h3>
<p>Exports the field and table names from the FileMaker database to a

added to the end. Useful for taking a list of stop IDs and adding the
stop names to the list.</p>
<h3 id="annupopulate">annupopulate</h3>

<p>These are located in the folder “Actium/applications” in the
PubInfSys – Documents library on Sharepoint. Some are saved as both
applications and also .scpt AppleScript files. Text versions are on
Github.</p>
<p>AppleScript is everybody’s least favorite language, and justifiably
so. Some of these scripts could be rewritten in Adobe’s ExtendScript
(their JavaScript version), but my understanding is that Adobe’s system
only allows automation of their particular app, and one can’t hand
information off from the Finder to Illustrator, or even from InDesign to
Illustrator, the way one can in AppleScript. (And I’ve read bad things
about Apple’s JavaScript for Automation although I haven’t tried
it.)</p>
<p>Originally, I wasn’t very careful about the way I wrote the path
specifications. There are still lots of paths specified in them using
paths with my username in them, for example. When I’ve made
modifications in recent years I’ve tried to do this better (using things
like “path to home folder” instead of “Users:apriven” or ‘POSIX file
‘/Users/apriven’), but I haven’t gone back and fixed the old ones. (One
of the irritating things about Applescript is that it likes to use the
old <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH218-SW28">Macintosh
