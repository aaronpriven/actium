=head1 NAME

Actium::O::Days - Object for holding scheduled days

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::O::Days;
 
 my $days = Actium::O::Days->new ('135');
 
 say $days->as_plurals; # "Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays"
 say $days->as_adjectives; # "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"
 say $days->as_abbrevs; # "Mon Wed & Fri"
 
 say $days->as_transitinfo; # 'MZ'
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used for objects storing scheduled day information. 
Trips, or timetables, are assigned to particular scheduled days.
Almost all the time this is either usually weekdays, Saturdays, 
or Sundays-and-Holidays.  However, there are lots of exceptions.
Some trips run only school days, while others run only school holidays. 
Some trips run only a few weekdays (e.g., Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays).

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item B<< Actium::O::Days->new(I<daycode> , I<schooldaycode>) >>

The object is constructed using "Actium::O::Days->new".  

It accepts a day specification 
as a string, containing any or all of the numbers 1 through 7 and optionally H.
If a 1 is present, it operates on Mondays; if 2, it operates on Tuesdays;
and so on through 7 for Sundays.  (7 is used instead of 0 for two reasons:
because Hastus provides it in this way, and because 0 is false in perl and it's
convenient to allow simple truth tests.)  The H, if present, is used to
indicate holidays. However, at this time the system will add an H to any 7
specified.

As an alternative, the two-letter codes derived from those used by the old 
www.transitinfo.org web site may be specified. See 
L<as_transitinfo|/as_transitinfo> below. 

The constructor also accepts a school days flag, a single character.
If specified, "D" indicates that it operates school days only, and "H" that 
it operates school holidays only. The default is "B", which indicates that 
operation on both school days and school holidays. (This is regardless of
whether school normally operates on that day -- weekend trips will 
still have "B" as the school day flag, unless there is a situation where
some school service is operated on a Saturday.)

=item B<< Actium::O::Days->new_from_string (I<string>) >>

This is an alternative constructor. It uses a single string, rather than
the separate daycode and schooldaycode, to construct an object and return it.

The only way to get a valid string is by using the I<as_string> object method.
The format of the string is internal and not guaranteed to remain the same
across versions of Actium::O::Days. The purpose of this is to allow a
single string to contain day information without requiring it to have all
the object overhead.

=item B<< Actium::O::Days->union(I<days_obj> , ... >>

Another constructor. It takes one or more Actium::O::Days objects and 
returns a new object representing the union of those objects. For example,
if passed an object representing Saturday and an object representing Sunday, 
will return an object representing both Saturday and Sunday.

If the school day codes of the passed objects are identical, it will use that
code. Otherwise it will use "B".

=back

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over

=item B<< $obj->daycode >>

Returns the day specification: a string with one or more of the characters
1 through 7, indicating operation on Monday through Sunday, and the character
H, indicating operation on holidays.

=item B<< $obj->schooldaycode >>

Returns one character. "D" indicates operation school days only. "H" indicates
operation school holidays only. "B" indicates operation on both types of days.
(Service on days when school service does not operate is also indicated 
by "B".)

=item B<< $obj->as_sortable >>

Returns a version of the day code / schoolday code that can be sorted using 
perl's cmp operator to be in order.

=item B<< $obj->as_string >>

Returns a version of the day code / schoolday code that can be used to create
a new object using B<new_from_string>.

=item B<< $obj->as_transitinfo >>

Returns the two-letter code for the day derived from the codes used by the 
old www.transitinfo.org web site.

Here is a table of equivalents:

      DA  1234567H    SU  7H      TF  25
      WD  12345       WE  67H     WF  35
      SA  6           TT  24      MZ  135
 
Since these codes do not allow for
the full range of possibilities, these codes probably should not be used
in new situations.

Where there is no valid code for the days, the code "XX" is returned and a
warning is generated (using "carp").

=item B<< $obj->as_adjectives >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in a
form intended for use to describe service: "This is <x> service."

The form is "Day, Day and Day" . The days used are as follows:

 Monday     Thursday   Sunday    Weekend
 Tuesday    Friday     Holiday   Daily
 Wednesday  Saturday   Weekday
 
May be followed by "(except school holidays)" or "(except school days)".

=item B<< $obj->as_plurals >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in a
form intended for use as nouns: "This service runs <x>."

The form is "Days, Days and Days" . The days used are as follows:

 Mondays     Thursdays   Sundays    Every day
 Tuesdays    Fridays     Holidays
 Wednesdays  Saturdays   
 
"Monday through Friday" is given instead of "Weekdays."
 
(Saturdays and Sundays are not combined into weekends here.)
 
May be followed by "(School days only)" or "(School holidays only)".

=item B<< $obj->as_abbrevs >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in as 
brief a form as possible, for tables or other places with little space.

The form is "Day Day & Day" . The days used are as follows:

 Mon     Thu    Sun       Daily
 Tue     Fri    Hol
 Wed     Sat    Weekday
 
May be followed by "(Sch days)" or "(Sch hols)".

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Holidays are hard-coded to always go with Sundays. At the very least 
holidays should be allowed to go with Saturdays, since some agencies run
a Saturday rather than Sunday schedule on holidays.
