=head1 NAME

Octium::Days - Object for holding scheduled days

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Octium::Days;
 
 my $days = Octium::Days->instance ('135');
 
 say $days->as_plurals; # "Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays"
 say $days->as_adjectives; # "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"
 say $days->as_abbrevs; # "Mon Wed & Fri"
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used for objects storing scheduled day information. 
Trips, or timetables, are assigned to particular scheduled days. Almost
all the time this is either usually weekdays, Saturdays,  or
Sundays-and-Holidays.  However, there are lots of exceptions. Some
trips run only school days, while others run only school holidays. 
Some trips run only a few weekdays (e.g., Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays).

This uses "flyweight" objects, meaning that it returns the same object
every time you pass particular arguments to construct it.  These
objects are immutable.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item B<< Octium::Days->instance(I<daycode> , I<schooldaycode>) >>

The object is constructed using "Octium::Days->instance".

The ->instance method accepts a day specification as a string,
containing any or all of the numbers 1 through 7 and optionally H. If a
1 is present, it operates on Mondays; if 2, it operates on Tuesdays;
and so on through 7 for Sundays.  (7 is used instead of 0 for two
reasons: because Hastus provides it in this way, and because 0 is false
in perl and it's convenient to allow simple truth tests.)  The H, if
present, is used to indicate holidays. However, at this time the system
will add an H to any 7 specified.

The constructor also accepts a school days flag, a single character. If
specified, "D" indicates that it operates school days only, and "H"
that  it operates school holidays only. The default is "B", which
indicates that  operation on both school days and school holidays.
(This is regardless of whether school normally operates on that day --
weekend trips will  still have "B" as the school day flag, unless there
is a situation where some school service is operated on a Saturday.)

=item B<< Octium::Days->new(I<daycode> , I<schooldaycode>) >>

B<< Do not use this method. >>

This method is used internally by Octium::Days to create a new object
and insert it into the cache used by instance(). There should never be
a reason to create more than one method with the same arguments.

=item B<< Octium::Days->instance_from_string (I<string>) >>

This is an alternative constructor. It uses a single string, rather
than the separate daycode and schooldaycode, to construct an object and
return it.

The only way to get a valid string is by using the I<as_string> object
method. The format of the string is internal and not guaranteed to
remain the same across versions of Octium::Days. The purpose of this is
to allow a single string to contain day information without requiring
it to have all the object overhead.

=item B<< Octium::Days->union(I<days_obj> , ... >>

Another constructor. It takes one or more Octium::Days objects and 
returns a new object representing the union of those objects. For
example, if passed an object representing Saturday and an object
representing Sunday,  will return an object representing both Saturday
and Sunday.

If the school day codes of the passed objects are identical, it will
use that code. Otherwise it will use "B".

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over

=item B<< $obj->daycode >>

Returns the day specification: a string with one or more of the
characters 1 through 7, indicating operation on Monday through Sunday,
and the character H, indicating operation on holidays.

=item B<< $obj->schooldaycode >>

Returns one character. "D" indicates operation school days only. "H"
indicates operation school holidays only. "B" indicates operation on
both types of days. (Service on days when school service does not
operate is also indicated  by "B".)

=item B<< $obj->as_sortable >>

Returns a version of the day code / schoolday code that can be sorted
using  perl's cmp operator to be in order.

=item B<< $obj->as_string >>

Returns a version of the day code / schoolday code that can be used to
create a new object using B<instance_from_string>.

=item B<< $obj->as_adjectives >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in a
form intended for use to describe service: "This is <x> service."

The form is "Day, Day and Day" . The days used are as follows:

 Monday     Thursday   Sunday    Weekend
 Tuesday    Friday     Holiday   Daily
 Wednesday  Saturday   Weekday
 
May be followed by "(except school holidays)" or "(except school
days)".

=item B<< $obj->as_plurals >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in a
form intended for use as nouns: "This service runs <x>."

The form is "Days, Days and Days" . The days used are as follows:

 Mondays     Thursdays   Sundays    Every day
 Tuesdays    Fridays     Holidays
 Wednesdays  Saturdays   
 
"Monday through Friday" is given instead of "Weekdays."

(Saturdays and Sundays are not combined into weekends here.)

May be followed by "(School days only)" or "(School holidays only)".

=item B<< $obj->as_abbrevs >>

This returns a string containing English text describing the days in as
 brief a form as possible, for tables or other places with little
space.

The form is "Day Day & Day" . The days used are as follows:

 Mon     Thu    Sun       Daily
 Tue     Fri    Hol
 Wed     Sat    Weekday
 
May be followed by "(Sch days)" or "(Sch hols)".

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Holidays are hard-coded to always go with Sundays. At the very least 
holidays should be allowed to go with Saturdays, since some agencies
run a Saturday rather than Sunday schedule on holidays.
