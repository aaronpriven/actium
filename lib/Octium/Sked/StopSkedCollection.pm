=head1 NAME

Octium::Sked::StopSkedCollection -  Object representing schedule info
for a particular bus stop or group of bus stops

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.015

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Octium::Sked::StopSkedCollection;
 # do something with Octium::Sked::StopSkedCollection
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This represents schedule information for a particular bus stop or group
of bus stops.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new(...)

The module inherits its constructor from Moose.

=head2 unbundle($string)

The C<unbundle> method takes a structure created by the C<bundle>
method and returns a recreated object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTE

=head2 stopskeds

An array of L<Octium::Sked::StopSked|Octium::Sked::StopSked> objects. 
The "stopskeds" argument in the constructor should be a reference to
the array, while the stopskeds() method will return the list.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 stopids

Returns a list of the stop IDs associated with the stop schedules.

=head2 stopskeds_of_stopid($stopid)

Takes a stop ID and returns the associated StopSked objects of that
stop ID.

=head2 bundle

This returns a struct which, when passed to the C<unbundle> class
method, will recreate the object.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None specific to this class.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The Actium system.
