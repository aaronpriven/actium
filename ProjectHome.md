Actium is a project to release publicly some code and data used to create public information materials for a transit agency (online timetables, printed schedules at stops) using a series of Perl programs, FileMaker databases and InDesign documents.

What's here now is the Perl programs, which I am slowly reorganizing and rewriting. It is not ready yet for anybody else to use, but perhaps those who are interested can at least see what it looks like.
