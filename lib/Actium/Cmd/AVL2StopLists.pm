=head1 NAME

avl2stoplists - Make stop lists by pattern and route from AVL files.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

avl2stoplists reads the data written by readavl and turns it into lists
of  stops by pattern and by route.  First it produces a list for each
pattern  (files in the form <route>-<direction>-<patternnum>.txt) and
then one for  each route (in the form <route>-<direction>.txt. Lists
for each pattern are merged using the Algorithm::Diff routine.
