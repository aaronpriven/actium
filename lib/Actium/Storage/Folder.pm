=head1 NAME

Actium::Storage::Folder - Folder objects for the Actium system

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Actium::Storage::Folder (qw/folder/);
 
 $folder = folder('/path/to/folder');

or, equivalently,

 $folder = Actium::Storage::Folder->new('/path/to/folder');

 $file = $folder->child('10_EB_WD.txt');
 # $file stringifies to something like /path/to/folder/10_EB_WD.txt

 @files = $folder->glob_files('*.txt');
 # @files contains objects for all the *.txt files 
 # in the '/path/to/folder' folder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Actium::Storage::Folder provides an object-oriented interface to
folders on disk. (They are referred to here as "folders" rather than
"directories" mainly because "dir" is more commonly used within the
Actium system as an abbreviation for "direction", and I wanted to avoid
ambiguity.)

It only adds methods to the L<Path::Class::Dir|Path::Class::Dir> module
 from CPAN.  All methods in Path::Class::Dir are supported by this
module, and readers should look at Path::Class::Dir for complete
documentation on it.

The following comprises documentation for methods in
Actium::Storage::Folder.

=cut

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head3 ensure_folder

Like L<C<new()> from Path::Class::Dir|Path::Class::Dir/new>,  but if it
does not already exist, creates the folder and any necessary parents.

=cut

method ensure_folder ($class: @pathcomponents) {
    return $class->new(@pathcomponents)->_ensure;
}

=head3 existing_folder

Like L<C<new()> from Path::Class::Dir|Path::Class::Dir/new>,  but
croaks if the folder does not already exist.

=cut

method existing_folder ($class: @pathcomponents) {
    return $class->new(@pathcomponents)->_must_exist;
}

=head3 file_class

Returns the class which is used to create file objects:
Actium::Storage::File.

=cut

sub file_class {
    require Actium::Storage::File;
    return 'Actium::Storage::File';
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 Folders and Files

=head3 exists

Returns a boolean value: true if there is actually a folder on the file
system associated with this object.

=cut

method exists {
    return ( -e -d $self );
}

=head3 is_folder

Returns a boolean value indicating whether this object represents a
folder. Actium::Storage::Folder objects always return true, and
Actium::Storage::File  objects always return false.

=cut

method is_folder {
    return 1;
}

=head2 Subfolders

=head3 subfolder

Returns a new Actium::Storage::Folder object representing a subfolder
of the object.

=cut

method subfolder (@subcomponents) {
    return $self->subdir(@subcomponents);
}

=head3 ensure_subfolder

Like C<subfolder()>, but if it does not already exist, creates the
folder and any necessary parents.

=cut

method ensure_subfolder (@subcomponents) {
    return $self->subfolder(@subcomponents)->_ensure;
}

=head3 existing_subfolder

Like <C<subfolder()>, but croaks if the folder does not already exist.

=cut

method existing_subfolder (@subcomponents) {
    return $self->subfolder(@subcomponents)->_must_exist;
}

method _ensure {
    $self->mkpath;
    return $self;
}

method _must_exist {
    Carp::croak "$self does not exist" unless $self->exists;
    return $self;
}

=head2 Files Within the Folder

=head3 grep (qr/regex/)

Returns the children (files or folders) which have a filename matching
the  supplied regular expression.

=cut

# expand someday to accept callbacks?

method grep ( RegexpRef $regex! ) {
    my @files       = $self->children;
    my %file_obj_of = map { $_->basename => $_ } @files;
    my @matching    = grep {/$regex/} keys %file_obj_of;
    return sort @file_obj_of{@matching};
}

=head3 glob( $pattern )

Returns a list of Actium::Storage::File or Actium::Storage::Folder
objects representing the children which have a filename matching the
supplied glob pattern. (See L<Text::Glob|Text::Glob> for the glob
pattern rules.)

=cut

method glob (Str $pattern //= '*') {
    require Text::Glob;
    my $regex = Text::Glob::glob_to_regex($pattern);
    return $self->grep($regex);
}

=head3 glob_files

Like C<glob>, but only returns file objects, not folder objects.

=cut

method glob_files (Str $pattern //= '*') {
    my @files = $self->glob($pattern);
    @files = grep { not( $_->is_folder ) } @files;
    return @files;
}

=head3 glob_folders

Like C<glob>, but only returns folder objects, not file objects.

=cut

method glob_folders (Str $pattern //= '*') {
    my @files = $self->glob($pattern);
    @files = grep { $_->is_folder } @files;
    return @files;
}

=head2 Writing Multiple Files In Their Entirety

=head3 spew_from_method

This routine takes a list of objects passed to it, takes the result of
an object method applied to each of those objects, and saves that
result in files in the specified folder.  The filename used will be the
result of the object's B<id> method, followed by the extension, if
provided. It takes named arguments, as follows:

=over

=item objects

A reference to an array of objects. The objects must implement the
methods passed in the C<method> and C<filename_method> arguments.

=item method

The name of a method the object is to perform. The results are saved in
the file.

Also, this name is used to determine the I/O layers used on the file. 
The routine looks to see whether a method  "METHOD_layers" is
implemented on the object (e.g., for a method "spaced",  it looks for
the additional method "spaced_layers"). If that method exists, it is
called, and the return value is passed to perl's binmode function. See
L<perlfunc/binmode>.

=item extension

An optional argument indicating a file extension to be appended to the 
filename, after a period.  (If omitted, no extension is used.)

=item subfolder

A path string representing the folder, or series of folders, under the 
folder represented by this object. This is where the series of files
are to be stored.

=item filename_method

The name of a method used to determine the filename of the resulting
file. If not specified, will use 'id'.

=item args

A reference to an array. This array is passed through as the arguments
to the method generating the data. If not specified, will use no
arguments.

=back

=cut

method spew_from_method ( 
    : \@objects !, 
    Str : $method !, 
    Str : $extension = $EMPTY, 
    Str : $subfolder? , 
    Str :$filename_method = 'id', 
    : \@args = [],
    ) {

    $extension =~ s/\A[.]*/./
      if ( $extension ne $EMPTY );

    my $folder = defined $subfolder ? $self->subfolder($subfolder) : $self;

    my $cry = cry("Writing $method files to $folder");

    my %seen_id;

    foreach my $obj (@objects) {
        my $id = $obj->$filename_method;
        $cry->over( $id . q[ ] );
        $seen_id{$id}++;
        $id .= "_$seen_id{$id}" unless 1 == $seen_id{$id};
        my $file = $self->file( $id . $extension );

        $file->spew_from_method(
            do_cry => 0,
            object => $obj,
            method => $method,
            args   => \@args,
        );
    }

    $cry->over($EMPTY);
    $cry->done;
    return;

} ## tidy end: method existing_folder3

=head3 spew_from_hash

This routine takes a hash reference and saves the hash values in files
named after the hash keys. It takes several named arguments:

=over

=item hash

A reference to a hash of strings.  The keys will be used as the
filenames  (with the extension, if any, appended). The values will be
used as the content of the files.

=item display_type

This is a string used in describing the files in feedback to the
terminal. If not given, will use 'hash'.

=item extension

The file extension. If it is not empty, it is added to the filename,
after a period.

=back

=cut

method spew_from_hash ( 
       :\%hash! , 
       :$display_type = 'hash' , 
       :$extension = $EMPTY 
    ) {

    $extension =~ s/\A[.]*/./
      if ( $extension ne $EMPTY );

    my $cry = cry("Writing $display_type files to  $self");

    foreach my $key ( sort keys %hash ) {

        $cry->over($key);

        my $filekey = $key =~ s{/}{-}gr;

        my $file = $self->file( $filekey . $extension );
        $file->spew_utf8( $hash{$key} );

    }

    $cry->over($EMPTY);
    $cry->done;
    return;

} ## tidy end: method existing_folder4
