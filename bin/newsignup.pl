# newsignup.pl part of AC's Single Timepoint Schedule program

# It creates the index files and data files used each time
# a Single Timepoint Schedule is created.

# To run this program, take the .scd files from Transitinfo and 
# put them in a directory. On a command-line system, run 
# the program with the directory name as the first entry in the 
# command line (such as "newsignup.pl /schedule/scd")

# Note that this assumes that the files are in the native text form
# (for DOS/Windows/NT, that is, the line ends are CR/LF).
