<h1 class="title">17. Clever route audio and attributes </h1>
</header>
<h1 id="communications-department-responsibility">Communications
Department responsibility</h1>
<p>There are several pieces of information that fall under
Communications’ responsibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Route audio (that is, the spoken route number or letter)</p></li>
<li><p>Destination audio (that is, audio that corresponds to the
headsign text). It also includes the fare information, which varies for
Transbay routes</p></li>
<li><p>Clever’s field “BusTimePublicRouteDirection” – this is the
direction destination</p></li>
<li><p>Clever’s field “BusTimePublicRouteDescription” – this is poorly
named, it is the pattern destination</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of other fields that I’ve ended up working on just
because they were easy to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clever’s field “TCHRouteVariantDescription” – this is what
operators see. I set this to the same as “BusTimePublic
RouteDescription”</p></li>
<li><p>Clever’s field “DestinationSign”. This is set from the Hastus
import into CleverWorks to be the vehicle display text, but for some
reason the import process doesn’t remove the repeated route numbers (so
this text looks like “88 DOWNTOWN BERKELEY 88 VIA MARKET STREET 88
SACRAMENTO STREET”). It was easy so I removed those numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cleverworks-process">CleverWorks process</h1>
<p>There’s a user interface in the CleverWorks system that allows
modification of these fields, which I won’t be going into.</p>
<p>Editing the route attribute and audio information in a more efficient
way begins with exporting the Route Attributes and Route Audio files.
The resulting files are “MA_Route_Audio_AC TRANSIT_2022-06-27T12.13.csv”
and “MA_Route_Attribute_AC TRANSIT_2022-06-27T12.14.csv” (with changed
date/time parts).</p>
<p>These are a comma-separated values files. If one is careful to make
sure Excel imports all the columns as “Text” format and not “General”
(using the “Text Import Wizard”), one can edit them in Excel, save
changes, and the re-upload it into CleverWorks.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly the best way to do this without writing any
code. Route audio and destination audio isn’t as difficult as stop
audio; there’s a lot less of it and copying and pasting it from previous
variants is usually okay. If it’s an audio file that doesn’t exist yet,
it should be clear.</p>
<p>But the way I chose to do it was to generate the full audio, each
time, from entries in the FileMaker database.</p>
<h1 id="data-used">Data used</h1>
<h2 id="filemaker-lines-table">FileMaker ”Lines” table</h2>
<p>There are several fields in this table referring specifically to
announcements.</p>
<p>The “annu_sign_text” field is used to override the line number if the
line number doesn’t match the audio file. For example, if there were an
audio recording called “N_L” that actually spoke the letters “NL”, one
would enter N_L into the annu_sign_text field.</p>
<p>The “annu_fare” field is either Local or Transbay and says whether
this bus line should have the local fare or the Transbay fare
information spoken after the destination. If it is Transbay and the
“NoLocalsOnTransbay” box isn’t checked, then it will have both sets of
fare information spoken.</p>
<h2 id="filemaker-annu-table">FileMaker “annu” table</h2>
<p>There “annu” table is used to associate the text on the sign (the
field “annu_sign_text”) with the audio file in CleverWorks that
represents that text (annu_audios).</p>
<p>The same audio file can be used for two different pieces of text, so
“Glen Ave.” and “Glenn Ave.” use the same audio file.</p>
<p>In some cases, a single piece of sign text is represented by multiple
audio files, so these are included, in comma-separated value format, in
the annu_audios field.</p>
<h2 id="output-from-avl2patdest">Output from avl2patdest</h2>
<p>The program reads the output files from avl2patdest
(pattern-destinations and direction-destinations). In the past few years
I’ve manually renamed those files with the signup name after I was done
with them, and this program expects that, so actium.pl routeannu -s w22
will expect to see files named pattern-destinations-w22.txt and
direction-destinations-w22.txt.\</p>
<h1 id="running-the-program">Running the program</h1>
<p>Running “actium.pl routeannu -s w22” (or whatever the signup is) will
read the latest audio and attribute export files the “cleverworks”
folder in the signup folder, and create new files in the same format,
suitable for importing into Cleverworks, calledr
oute_attribute_import.csv and route_audio_import.csv.</p>
<p>If during the run, the computer program finds headsign text or a
route number that does not have an equivalent audio file entry (that is,
there’s no entry in the annu table for it), it will leave the value “***
NO AUDIO ***” in the routeaudio_import.csv file. One should open up the
routeaudio_import.csv file and look for values of “*** NO VALUE ***”,
and then fix the values in the FileMaker database associated with the
sign text by adding a new audio file entry corresponding to that sign
text.</p>
<p>Once the program has ben re-run and generated no “*** NO VALUE ***”
entries, the file is done, and can be imported into CleverWorks. You
have to import the files in the Import Attributes screen under the
“Import” tab, and then and then accept all the changes in “Attribute
Updates”, also under the “Import” tab.</p>
<h1 id="adding-audio-files">Adding audio files</h1>
<p>If a piece of text has no audio file in the “annu” table, the easiest
thing to do is just to add a new entry, and just put the text in twice.
When the file is uploaded into CleverWorks, assuming there’s no existing
entry in the audio inventory by that name, it will create a new entry.
The request can then be sent to Clever Devices to have their audio
talent make a recording of it. (Sometimes I’ve sent a recording of my
own voice saying the words to the talent, just to clarify any ambiguous
spellings.)</p>
<p>There are a lot of audio files in the CleverWorks inventory, but I
could only add those that were actively associated with a stop or route
to the “annu” table in FileMaker. There may already be an audio
recording that says the same thing as your new text. You can search the
existing inventory to see if any file names seem to match.</p>
<p>One of the more irritating things about CleverWorks is its treatment
of audio file names. Inside the system, audio file names can have either
spaces or underscores, but both are shown as spaces in the CleverWorks
user interface. The only way to find out how to actually specify an
existing audio file is to associate it with a stop or route in the UI,
export that attribute file, and see what the result was in the
downloaded attribute file. Then that text can be added in the
annu_stop_audios field.</p>
<h1 id="incomplete-projects">Incomplete projects</h1>
<p>There are a couple of fields that I am not touching with my programs,
but I’m not 100% sure are being handled by other people working in
CleverWorks. These are “FareBoxFareSetID” in the route attributes file
(I believe 0 sets the value to local fares, and 1 to Transbay fares, but
I’m not sure how it should deal with locals-OK transbay lines like F and
NL). The other is “DestinationSignCode” which should come out of Hastus
but may not be.</p>
<h1 id="future">Future</h1>
<p>Route audio and attribute information is less error prone than stop
data, and it’s not unreasonable to consider doing this manually. Still,
it would be good to keep the automatic processing complete.</p>
