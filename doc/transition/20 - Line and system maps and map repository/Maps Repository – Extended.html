<h1 class="title">The Actium Maps Repository:<br />
Extended Usage and Technical Detail</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Aaron Priven, February 2012</p>
</header>
<p>This document contains more detail about the Actium Maps Repository
than can be found in the Quick Start guide. It is useful for
understanding how the repository works and taking advantage of other
details of the mr_import and mr_copy programs.</p>
<h1 id="repository-folder-structure-and-folder-names">Repository folder
structure and folder names</h1>
<p>The repository has a very simple folder structure. There is a base
folder of the repository, which is “/Volumes/Bireme/Maps/Repository” by
default, and one level of subsidiary folders within that.</p>
<p>There are two types of subsidiary folders within the repository.
Folders that do not start with an underscore (_) are the storage
folders, and contain the main copies of the maps. Folders that do start
with an underscore are special, and store copies of the maps from the
other folders.</p>
<p>The storage folders have names that are one or more descriptors
separated by underscores. Usually these descriptors are the designations
of the bus lines shown on the maps. So, for example, the folder covering
line 7 will be called simply “7”. Folders with maps describing more than
one line will have the lines separated by underscores: for example,
“1_1R_801”. Descriptors can consist only of letters or numbers (no
special characters).</p>
<p>The descriptors of the storage folders can be any length. If they are
four characters or fewer, it is assumed they are bus line designations,
and will be converted to uppercase when imported using the mr_import
command. Longer names are assumed to be other sorts of names (for
example, “PosterMap” or “Fremont” for various segments of the system
map) and are not converted.</p>
<p>There should be no folders within any of the storage folders or
special folders.</p>
<h1 id="repository-file-names">Repository file names</h1>
<p>The file name of each map in the repository is in a special format,
with a number of components separated by hyphens (and a file extension,
separated from the rest of the name by a period). That format is as
follows:</p>
<p><em>&lt;descriptor&gt;-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;</em></p>
<p>Some files, generally older ones, may have an additional
component:</p>
<p><em>&lt;descriptor&gt;=&lt;token&gt;-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;</em></p>
<p>The “token” component is separated from the descriptor by an equals
sign, not a hyphen.</p>
<h2 id="descriptor">Descriptor</h2>
<p>The descriptor should be exactly the same as the descriptor of the
storage folder. It is one or more bus line designations separated by
underscores, or a longer descriptor for a segment of the system map.
Examples are “7”, “1_1R_801”, or “PosterMap.” As in folder names,
segments of the descriptor shorter than five characters are expected to
be line names and converted to uppercase, while longer names are left
alone. Descriptors can consist of letters or numbers only, no special
characters.</p>
<p>The mr_import program understands that commas may be used instead of
underscores, but converts them to underscores before copying the
files.</p>
<h2 id="token">Token</h2>
<p>The token is used to distinguish two different maps with the same
descriptor that will be used simultaneously. An example would be lines M
or U, which formerly had one map for the East Bay and a second separate
map for the West Bay. These were given tokens such as “e” or “w”, so in
total the filenames looked something like “M=e-2004_08-v2.eps”.</p>
<p>At this writing (Feburary, 2012), these are not currently used, but
at some future point they may again be useful.</p>
<h2 id="date">Date</h2>
<p>The date of a map contains only a numeric year, separated by an
underscore by a numeric month (which must be two digits). An example
would be “2012_02” for February 2012. The mr_import program understands
dates in the form of “feb12”, but converts them to numeric dates before
copying the files.</p>
<h2 id="version">Version</h2>
<p>The version of a map is used to distinguish when a map has been
revised more than once within a month. Whichever version sorts last
alphabetically is used. (Numbers sort before letters, so “1” and “2” are
considered earlier than “v1” and “v2”.)</p>
<p>(In the past we occasionally used the version component for other
kinds of differences. For example, for a long time we received two
different .pdf versions from Eureka – a “web” version formatted to print
at 8.5 by 11, and a regular version formatted to print at the same size
as the map in the printed timetables. The “web” version generally used
version numbers beginning with “wv” while the regular version used
version numbers beginning with “v”. These are no longer being
produced.)</p>
<h2 id="extension">Extension</h2>
<p>The extension is a standard file extension, such as “.eps” for
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, or “.pdf” for Portable Document
Format (PDF) files. While a file with any extension may be placed in an
archive, the programs assume that .eps files and .pdf files will be
present.</p>
<h1 id="files-for-the-web">Files for the Web</h1>
<p>Both mr_import and mr_copy make copies of the maps intended for the
web site. Two sorts of changes must be made to the maps for the Web.</p>
<p>Firstly, the AC Transit web site does not know that the same map is
used for several different bus lines. It cannot cope with the idea that
“1_1R_801-…” may be used for all three of the relevant lines. Thus,
files saved for the web are copied once for each line: the map beginning
with 1_1R_801 will be copied to 1.pdf, 1R.pdf, and 801.pdf.</p>
<p>Secondly, the AC Transit web site needs a JPEG version of the map for
the pan-and-zoom map display. So JPEG files are created, again with one
copy for each line: 1.jpg, 1R.jpg, and 801.jpg.</p>
<h1 id="the-mr_import-program">The mr_import program</h1>
<p>mr_import takes one or more folders where maps may exist. First, it
checks the names of each of those files, and if it can, puts it into the
proper name style for the repository. Second, it copies the files to the
repository. Third, it creates versions of the PDF files for the web.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The mr_import program takes files and copies them into the
repository. You run it by entering the following into the Terminal
(shell):</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import /Name/Of/A/Folder</p>
<p>or, for more than one folder,</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import <em>/Folder1 /Folder2 /AndSoOn</em></p>
<p>One of the most usual ways is to “cd” to the appropriate folder in
the Terminal and simply enter (note the period):</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import .</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>The mr_import program has several options that can be used on the
command line. These should be placed after mr_import:</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import –no-web _new</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import –repository /Users/myname/MyRepository _new</p>
<p>A full list of options can be seen by typing</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_import -help</p>
<p>However, in practice only a few of them are actually useful.</p>
<h3 id="move">-move</h3>
<p>This option moves, rather than copies, the files into the repository.
They will be removed from the specified folder once they are copied
successfully.</p>
<p>This option is on by default. To copy instead of moving, so the maps
will remain in the folder you specify, enter “-no-move” on the command
line. “move” can be abbreviated as “mv”</p>
<h3 id="repository">-repository</h3>
<p>The repository is currently located at
“/Volume/Bireme/Maps/Repository”. To use another repository, specify its
full path here.</p>
<h3 id="web">-web</h3>
<p>This option will create a folder called “web” underneath the folder
you specify, and create copies of the maps intended for the web in them.
(See “Files for the web,” above.)</p>
<p>This option is on by default. To suppress the creation of web files,
enter “‑no‑web” on the command line.</p>
<h3 id="webfolder">-webfolder</h3>
<p>An alternative folder where web files will be created, instead of
“web” under the specified folder. This will be the same for all files
converted (it doesn’t just replace the folder “web”within each folder
with a new name, it specifies a single folder where all converted files
will be located). “webfolder” can be abbreviated “wf”.</p>
<h3 id="quiet--verbose-and-progress">-quiet, -verbose, and
–progress</h3>
<p>These three options tell the program how much detail to display on
screen.</p>
<p>“-quiet” eliminates all display except text that describes why the
program quit unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“-verbose” displays on the screen a message indicating the names of
each map copied or rasterized.</p>
<p>“-progress” produces a running indication of which lines’ maps are
being processed, when “‑verbose” is not in effect. This is on by
default; use “-no-progress” to turn it off.</p>
<h1 id="the-mr_copy-program">The mr_copy program</h1>
<p>Because the repository consists of regular files in the file system,
no special technique is necessary to view them: simply open the files as
with any file. However, a program called “mr_copy” is provided to help
gather all the latest maps from the system together.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1">Usage</h2>
<p>mr_copy goes through the repository and keeps track of the very
latest map of each set of lines. It then takes each map of the latest
date (that is, all the versions with the same date and version – whether
EPS, PDF, or something else) and copies them three times to special
folders in the repository:</p>
<p>1) to the “_fullnames” folder. In this folder the file will keep its
full name, including date and version.</p>
<p>2) to the “_linesnames” folder. In this folder the file will be named
only by its lines (and token if present). So “1_1R_801-2012_02-v1.eps”
would become just “1_1R_801.eps”</p>
<p>3) to the “_web” folder. The PDF version, only, of the latest file
will be copied to this folder once for each line. (So, for example,
“1_1R_801-2012_02-v1.pdf” will be copied three times, as “1.pdf”,
“1R.pdf”, and “801.pdf”.) Also, JPEG versions of each PDF file will be
created (“rasterized”), also multiple copies for each line (“1.jpg”,
“1R.jpg”, “801.jpg”).</p>
<h2 id="active_maps.txt">active_maps.txt</h2>
<p>mr_copy relies on a file within the repository called
“active_maps.txt” to know what maps are active. Otherwise, it has no way
of knowing which lines are currently being operated and which ones are
purely historical. The active_maps.txt is a simple text file. Each line
contains the lines (and token, if necessary) of an active map:</p>
<p>1_1R_801<br />
7<br />
11<br />
12<br />
M=e<br />
M=w</p>
<p>Lines in active_maps.txt do not have to be specified in order.</p>
<h2 id="usage-2">Usage</h2>
<p>The mr_copy program takes files from the repository and copies the
latest ones to the special folders. You run it by entering the following
into the Terminal (shell):</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy</p>
<h2 id="options-1">Options</h2>
<p>The mr_copy program has several options that can be used on the
command line. These should be placed after mr_import:</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy –no-web</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy –repository /Users/me/MyRepository</p>
<p>A full list of options can be seen by typing</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy -help</p>
<p>However, in practice only a few of them are actually useful.</p>
<h3 id="activemapfile">-activemapfile</h3>
<p>This allows the user to use a different file than active_maps.txt as
the list of active maps. The file must, however, still be located in the
repository folder.</p>
<h3 id="fullfolder">-fullfolder</h3>
<p>This allows you to change where copies with the full names are made.
The default is “_fullnames” in the repository. Use “-fullfolder” to
specify another location on the file system:</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy –fullfolder<br />
/Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/CurrentLineMaps</p>
<p>“fullfolder” can be abbreviated “ff”.</p>
<h3 id="fullnames">-fullnames</h3>
<p>This option will copy the files into the “_fullnames” folder (or
whatever the ‑fullfolder option specifies). This is on by default. To
suppress copying of full names files, use “-no-fullnames” on the command
line.</p>
<h3 id="linesfolder">-linesfolder</h3>
<p>This allows you to change where copies with just the line names are
made. The default is “_linesnames” in the repository. Use “-linesfolder”
to specify another location on the file system:</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy –linesfolder<br />
/Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/LineMapsNoDates</p>
<p>“linesfolder” can be abbreviated “lf”.</p>
<h3 id="linesnames">-linesnames</h3>
<p>This option will copy the files into the “_linesnames” folder (or
whatever the ‑linesfolder option specifies). This is on by default. To
suppress copying of lines names files, use “-no-linesnames” on the
command line.</p>
<h3 id="repository-1">-repository</h3>
<p>The repository is currently located at
“/Volume/Bireme/Maps/Repository”. To use another repository, specify its
full path here.</p>
<h3 id="web-1">-web</h3>
<p>This option will copy the files into the “_web” folder (or whatever
the –webfolder option specifies), and create the JPEG files. This is on
by default. To suppress copying and rasterization of web files, use
“-no-web” on the command line.</p>
<p>Rasterization takes the longest time so I suspect “-no-web” is the
most likely option to be used.</p>
<h3 id="webfolder-1">-webfolder</h3>
<p>This allows you to change where web files made. The default is “_web”
in the repository. Use “-webfolder” to specify another location on the
file system:</p>
<p>actium.pl mr_copy –webfolder<br />
/Volumes/SHARE$/District Public Share/Apriven/MapsForWeb</p>
<h3 id="quiet--verbose-and-progress-1">-quiet, -verbose, and
–progress</h3>
<p>These three options tell the program how much detail to display on
screen.</p>
<p>“-quiet” eliminates all display except text that describes why the
program quit unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“-verbose” displays on the screen a message indicating the names of
each map copied or rasterized.</p>
<p>“-progress” produces a running indication of which lines’ maps are
being processed, when “‑verbose” is not in effect. This is on by
default; use “-no-progress” to turn it off.</p>
