# Goes through the source code and finds everything marked with a dependency
# tag on the same line.  Omits Actium dependencies since the purpose of it
# is to identify which modules need to be installed for Actium to work.

# This handles most of the typical "use" and "require" statements such that
# just adding the tag on the use or require line will work. Otherwise
# they can be added on comment lines with the tag.
