# actium.pl - command-line access to Actium system

# Legacy Stage 3

# This is the single executable file that allows access to various Actium
# commands. There are a couple of reasons for this. The main one is that I
# would like to rewrite the modules so that they can provide data that can
# be reused in other programs. With standalone programs it's been difficult
# to do that. Also, littering the world with lots of little executables seems
# like a bad idea.

# The below make sure that all errors give full stack traces.
# This should be changed to a command-line option
