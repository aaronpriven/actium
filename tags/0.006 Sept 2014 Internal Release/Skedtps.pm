# tphash = the timepoint names. tphash("14TH BDWY") is 
# "Fourteenth St. & Broadway."

# tpxref = the cross-referenced timepoint abbreviation
# tpxref("BDWY 14TH") could be "14TH BDWY".

# tpxref and tphash subroutines strip punctuation.. the only characters
# used to determine the different timepoint names are [A-Za-z0-9= ]
# (note space) (but actually a trailing =[0-9] are stripped too)

# This is mainly to deal with a FileMaker quirk: it thinks "C.V. PKRD"
# is the same as "C,V, PKRD" and "DEJE M.S" the same as "DEJE M.S."
# so won't let you enter the second ones if the first ones are already there
# (in fields marked "unique")  Which is a good thing I guess. But requires
# this code to deal with it.
