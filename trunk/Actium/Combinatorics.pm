sub ordered_partitions {

    # The idea here is that partitions are identified by a combination
    # of numbers representing the breaks between items.

    # So if you have items qw<a b c d e> then the possible breaks are
    # after a, after b, after c, or after d --
    # numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3.

    # If you have two frames, then you have one break between them.
    # If you have three frames, then you have two breaks between them.

    # This gets all the combinations of breaks between them and
    # then creates the subsets that correspond to those breaks,
    # and returns the subsets. So, if you have two frames, the results are
    # [ a] [ b c d e] , [ a b ] [ c d e] , [a b c] [ d e ], [a b c d] [e].

    # These sorted by which one we'd want to use first
    # (primarily, which combination yields even results, and then
    # if it can't be even, having the extra one at the front rather than
    # at the back or the middle)

    # This differs from
    # Algorithm::Combinatorics::partitions(\@tables, $num_frames)
    # only that it preserves the order. partitions could return
    # [ b] [ a c d e]
    # but this routine will never do that.
    # I am not sure whether this is actually good or not.  Wouldn't
    # it be weird to have a big NX1 table followed by small NX and NX2 tables?
    # If not, then this could be replaced with partitions, as above.
