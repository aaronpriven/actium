### Time

class_type Time, { class => 'Actium::Time' };
coerce Time, from Str, via { Actium::Time->from_str($_) };
# can't coerce from a number because '515' could be a time number
# or a string representing 5:15 am

### Direction

class_type Dir, { class => 'Actium::Dir' };
coerce Dir, from Str, via { Actium::Dir->instance($_) };

### Crier fields

declare CrierStatus,     as Int, where { -7 <= $_ and $_ <= 7 };
declare CrierImportance, as Int, where { 0 <= $_  and $_ <= 7 };
